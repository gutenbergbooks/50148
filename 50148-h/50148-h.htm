</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The author respectfully submits it as his firm and
immovable conviction, that the United States of America, in years to
come, will govern the entire Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="par">The Stars and Stripes which never knew, nor ever will
know defeat, will, in years to come, gather under its protecting folds,
every nation and every island in this hemisphere.</p>
<p class="par">It is a duty we Americans owe to the republics of
Central and South America to give them the benefits of our pacific
government, the rule of the People, by and for the People, exemplified
in the great Constitution of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="par">America has to-day an inviolable Monroe Doctrine. Any
attempt on the part of Europe to violate the spirit or letter of that
wise doctrine, would be promptly resented by America.</p>
<p class="par">Our American flag already protects and defends every
republic in the Americas. How many years will it require to convince
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>the Central and South American Republics that their
security and path of safety is to come under the flag that already
protects them?</p>
<p class="par">The purpose of this book is to clearly establish this
important fact in the mind of every patriotic American. Our glorious,
starry banner will rule the entire Western Hemisphere. It will be the
emblem of Peace, Liberty and Civilization, floating over a united
America from Alaska to Patagonia. This is America&rsquo;s Destiny.</p>
<p class="par">In setting forth this great truth the author has avoided
the well beaten paths and dusty roads travelled by writers from the
days of the Deluge up to the hour of going to press, and it is to be
hoped that the reader, now and then, may find some refreshing scenery
along his pathway.</p>
<p class="par">If this book serves to stimulate patriotic pride and
strengthen respect for our liberty-loving flag, it then will not have
been written in vain.</p>

<p class="par first">A Dream of Magnificent Expansion. America becomes
the Mightiest Nation of the World and extends her Domain from Alaska to
Patagonia.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Gauged by certain standards and viewed from
certain standpoints, a mere century is but a brief compass of time.</p>
<p class="par">From an individual point of view, in the daily routine
of life, a century appears to be an embryo-eternity. When time is
gauged with clock like precision and to each minute is allotted its
full value, a century assumes an unfathomable depth. But, in the cycles
of time, a century is a mere footprint in the passage of time; a small
link in the endless chain of eternity.</p>
<p class="par">Time is easily annihilated by mental process.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>Witness the feat performed by Mahomet, related in a
certain chapter of the <span class="marginnote">Mahomet on Rapid
Transit.</span> Koran. The faithful are informed in this passage of the
Koran that the Prophet was awakened one morning from a deep, refreshing
slumber by an angel and was summoned into Paradise to confer with
Allah. While in the act of ascending to Heaven, Mahomet&rsquo;s foot
struck and upset a pitcher of water which stood near the couch. The
Koran unblushingly proclaims that the Prophet held 999 long conferences
with Allah and had safely returned to his couch, ready for another
snooze, before the water in the falling pitcher had time to spill on
the floor!</p>
<p class="par">There is something very refreshing in this narrative. It
shows that Mahomet was well up in rapid transit matters and again it
proves the sublime virtue of a man, a son of the desert, a turbaned
Washington, who couldn&rsquo;t tell a lie and who resisted the
temptation to make this batch of conferences with Allah an even
thousand. Mahomet missed his calling; he ought to have been a newspaper
reporter.</p>
<p class="par">Assuming the prerogatives of the Koran, the author, at
one stroke of his pen, proposes to annihilate time. Plunged into a
profound slumber he had a dream. Great men and little men; the renowned
and the ignorant; the philosopher and the Australian bushman; quakers
and cannibals; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>prince and the peasant, all these and myriads of
others, have had their dreams. Love&rsquo;s dream has been the theme of
all ages, the burden of songs untold. The dream of conquest, the dream

within the human brain.</p>
<p class="par">But the author&rsquo;s dream is not swayed by human
emotions; it is not the handmaid of <span class=
"marginnote">America&rsquo;s Giant Republic, 1999.</span> passion. It
is a dream that unseals the book of the future and reveals to the world
the colossal, peace-loving, giant republic of the universe in the year
of our Lord, 1999,</p>
<p class="par"><i>The United States of the Americas</i>, the mightiest
nation ever known in contemporaneous history.</p>
<p class="par">It is related that at a national anniversary celebration
dinner, held a few years ago, in the classic regions of Chicago, while
the toasts were being dissected, a guest arose and proposed to
&ldquo;Our Country,&rdquo;&mdash;the United States of America, bounded
on the north by Canada; on the south by the Gulf of Mexico; on the east
by the Atlantic and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Another gentleman
arose and protested warmly against the narrow limits as ascribed to our
beloved country. &ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;drink to
the prosperity of the United States of America,&mdash;bounded on the
north by the North Pole; on the south by the Antarctic Region; on the
east by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>first chapter of the Book of Genesis and on the west
by the Day of Judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At the <i lang="fr">fin-de-siecle</i> of the twentieth
century, in the year of our Lord, 1999, the United States of the
Americas were virtually bounded as above related. The comparatively
small segment of territory known and officially recognized in 1899 as
the United States of America, still retained in 1999 its predominant
importance, yet this territory in the twentieth century became only a
small fraction of an integral whole. In 1899, compared with its
neighbors, the United States of America appeared like a whale by the
side of little fishes,&mdash;a large loaf compared with which its
neighbor-nations in Central and South America resembled little
biscuits,&mdash;half baked at that.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 the little fishes were glad to come to the great
American whale for protection and become a part of our grand union. Our
glorious and ever-victorious banner remained precisely the same in
1999, as it must ever remain for centuries yet unborn, the pride of
America and the glory of the world. The stripes on our noble flag were
still red and white alternately; the only difference was in the number
of the stars on the field of blue; they had increased from forty-five
to <span class="corr" id="xd21e240" title=
"Source: eight-five">eighty-five</span> and Old Glory proudly waved in
1999 over one mighty united republic from Baffin&rsquo;s Bay to the
straits of Magellan.</p>
<p class="par">Place in your hand an acorn. Pause as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>you gaze
upon it, consider the mighty giant which slumbers within its bosom. It
is only an acorn,&mdash;a mere pigmy. Plant it; watch it as it develops
into a mighty, towering oak, which, in its majesty of strength seems to
bid defiance to the very heavens. Beneath its massive branches and
grateful shade the weary traveller may pause to rest his limbs and seek
refuge from the heat of day.</p>
<p class="par">Our pilgrim fathers were the &ldquo;acorns&rdquo; of the
colossal republic known in 1999 as <span class="marginnote">Commenced
on a Small Scale.</span> the United States of the Americas. Little did
they those pure and sturdy fathers, dream that from their loins would
spring the greatest and grandest government descended to men since the
promulgation of the Decalogue. From small beginnings, great ends may
often be accomplished. The avalanche that rolls and thunders down the
mountain side, sweeping before it forests and boulders, begins business
in a very small way. A little handful of snow starts the uproar but
before its headlong career has terminated, the very mountain itself
trembles beneath the mad rush.</p>
<p class="par">So it was with that splendid political structure, known
in 1999 as the United States of the Americas. Its humble origin was
<span class="corr" id="xd21e254" title="Source: easy">easily</span>
traceable to Plymouth Rock. From the landing of the pilgrims to the
close of the nineteenth century, the rapid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>growth
of the Federal States left nothing to be desired. But in the nineteenth
century America was still an acorn, from which a mighty oak was to be
reared in 1999, a tree under whose branches were sheltered in one
mighty republic all the territory from Hudson&rsquo;s Bay to Cape
Horn.</p>
<p class="par">In the year of our Lord 1999 the world gazed with an
admiration, akin to awe, upon <span class="marginnote">Eighty-five
States in the Union.</span> the <span class="corr" id="xd21e264" title=
"Source: magnificient">magnificent</span> spectacle presented by the
United States of the Americas, a colossal republic, embracing
eighty-five states, bounded on its northern apex by the states of
Alaska, East and West Canada, while the state of Patagonia guarded the
extreme south of the American giant, including all islands of the seas
lying in the Western Hemisphere, between the Arctic and Antarctic
regions.</p>
<p class="par">It frequently happens that the insignificant child of
to-day, soon becomes, by reason of growth and intellectual force, the
leader of the family, a tower of might and strength in their midst, one
to whom they look for counsel and protection.</p>
<p class="par">So it was with America, the Child of Destiny. In 1776
America was a mere infant, attached to the breast of a harsh, unloving
mother. By leaps and bounds this American infant budded into childhood,
and in the year of 1899 had already become a busy, good-natured youth,
whose prowess, industry and great future already commanded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>the
respect of the world. In 1899 the western hemisphere was politically
divided into independent republics, with the minor exception of certain
European dependencies, belonging to England, France and Denmark. The
United States in the year last named was universally regarded as a
prodigy in the family of nations. Its magnificent resources and its
expanding industries; its keen inventive genius; its limitless
<span class="marginnote">A Big Fellow, Decidedly.</span> agricultural
wealth; its absolute liberty and entire freedom from militarism,
challenged the envy as well as the admiration of the world, while the
naval and military prowess of the young American Republic, evidenced in
the Spanish-American unpleasantness of 1898, exacted from other nations
a wholesome and enduring respect.</p>
<p class="par">Such, in brief, was the condition of America in 1899.
Little indeed was the popular mind prepared for the extraordinary
developments and the remarkable series of events that brought about in
1999 the creation of the United States of the Americas. In that
memorable year all of the independent republics of Central and South
America had joined our union and were governed under the great
Constitution of 1776, which is and always will be, the most inspiring
document that ever issued from the pen of man, one that will continue
to bless mankind as lone as the sun retains <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>its

<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">The Mighty Oregon and the Little Yankee Schooner
met on the high seas. &ldquo;Let us keep together for mutual
protection.&rdquo; Mexico the first republic to join our union. The
Central and South American Republics all stampede for the shelter of
the great American Eagle. Peru joins our union in 1921, Venezuela in
1925, Canada comes stumbling along in 1930.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Every American patriot recollects with feelings of
pride and admiration the great voyage of the U. S. battleship Oregon,
the noblest floating citadel of the nineteenth century, during the
spring of the year 1898, from the Golden Gate to Jupiter, Florida, a
distance of over 14,000 miles. With only five first-class battleships
to its credit, it was of paramount importance for the U. S. government
to secure the services of the Oregon to join in the volcanic welcome
that awaited the arrival of Admiral Cervera&rsquo;s squadron in the
Caribbean sea.</p>
<p class="par">The memory of that eventful voyage will remain vivid in
the recollections of more than one generation. After the noble vessel
had rounded the turbulent waters of Magellan and her stout prow pointed
north, anxiety for her safety increased at every knot she covered. The
Spanish phantom, at that critical period of the war, looked
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>like a towering mountain, an elevation, however,
which was designed to be soon transformed, by subsequent events, into a
mole-hill.</p>
<p class="par">One bright afternoon, while steaming in latitude 30&deg;
south and in longitude 40&deg; <span class="marginnote">A Saucy Little
Yankee Craft.</span> west, shortly before touching at Rio Janerio, the
great Oregon spoke an insignificant, one-masted little schooner, a mere
shell, tossing upon South Atlantic billows, with a crew of two men. The
fact that the diminutive sail boat proudly unfurled at her masthead the
glorious flag of America, was the sole feature, in her case, that saved
her from utter insignificance. The Oregon displayed signals, asking the
captain of the little vessel if he had spoken any Spanish war-vessels
adding, as a matter of information, that war had been declared between
Spain and the United States of America.</p>
<p class="par">It happened that this was the first intimation the
captain of the schooner had received that a state of war existed
between the two countries above named. In reply he promptly signalled
to the Oregon that he had not seen any Spanish men-of-war, and, being
somewhat of a Yankee humorist, added, that if war had been declared,
the best thing that they could do would be &ldquo;to keep together for
mutual protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"></p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This anecdote of the recontre of the Oregon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>and the
tiny schooner illustrates aptly the conditions that ruled in 1999 and
during several preceding decades. In that year was witnessed a grand
union of all the peoples of the Western Hemisphere under the starry
banner of America. The little Republics of Central and South America
were heartily glad to seek the protection of the Great Leviathan of the
North, and, gathered into one great Republic, <i>The United States of
the Americas</i>, they stood together one and indivisible, &ldquo;for
mutual protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 the world beheld the imposing spectacle of a
United America, a nation in magnitude and power that eclipsed any
previously known confederation of States, invincible in war and
unrivalled in arts, sciences and industry. The Americas were all under
the protection of the same stars and stripes, employing the same legal
tender and coinage and in 1999 the English tongue had been adopted
officially by every Central and South American State.</p>
<p class="par">The first Republic that knocked at our gates for
admission into the grand union of <span class="marginnote">Mexico makes
the First Break.</span> the Americas, was Mexico. In the year 1520, the
Spaniards, under Cortes, that valiant and most intrepid of Castillian
warriors, had already crushed that most dreaded of all barbarian
monarchs, Montezuma, and had reduced the Aztec Empire into vassalage
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>and slavery. In 1898, by a series of the most
brilliant victories, American prowess and arms, coupled with dare-devil
bravery and resolute fighting, had in turn driven out the Spanish
hordes from the Americas. With this turn in the tide of history,
nothing could be more fitting than the incorporation of Mexico as a
State in our Federal Union. Could they have witnessed our brilliant
American victories against Spain in 1898, Montezuma and his Aztec
warriors would have arisen from their graves and shouted for joy at the
knowledge that at last their wrongs at the hands of Spain had been
avenged by the sword of America and their Spanish oppressors of 1520
had at last been hurled back to the Castillian haunts from whence they
had emerged under Columbus and Cortes.</p>
<p class="par">Mexico added a new star to our flag in 1912, just one
hundred years after England and America crossed swords. These swords
have been sheathed in their scabbards, never again in the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e329" title="Source: word&rsquo;s">world&rsquo;s</span>
history to be unsheathed against one another.</p>
<p class="par">As early as the year 1899 the desire to join our
American Union began to manifest <span class="marginnote">Awakening of
the Americas.</span> itself. In that year the little island of Jamaica
already had under advisement the question of joining the American
Union, and the people of Jamaica were seriously agitating the matter.
They regarded this step as one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>that would benefit their
material prosperity. This belief was shared by the inhabitants of the
other West Indian islands and gained strength with every year,
culminating in 1912 in the action taken by Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">The incorporation of Mexico into our grand American
Union created a profound sensation, not only in the Americas, but,
also, throughout the world. It was a purely voluntary act on the part
of Mexico, one which could not be fondly ascribed by the ever-jealous
nations of Europe to &ldquo;Yankee greed.&rdquo; It brought about a
distinctive turn in the tide and the conviction became firm in the
minds of all that the example of Mexico would be followed, sooner or
later, by every Republic in Central and South America.</p>
<p class="par">In 1920 public opinion in Peru became ripe for a change.
The affairs of that Republic had been unsuccessfully administered and
the land of the Incas seemed likely in that year to be devastated by
Chile, that active and more or less prosperous people, sometimes called
the &ldquo;Yankees of South America.&rdquo; The prospect of another
disastrous war with Chile crystalized public opinion in Peru and
hastened action on her part. In the following year of 1921, Peru became
a State in our Union. Venezuela came next in 1925, then followed in
rapid succession the entire group of Central American States,
Guatemala, Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1930 Canada at last joined the American Union. Canada
had long occupied the position of an old maid in reference to the
Union; she had been entirely willing for many years, but had withheld
her consent; England, of course, had to be consulted, and with the
utmost good nature was present at the wedding ceremonies, giving away
the Canadian bride into our union in a most gracious manner.</p>
<p class="par">Between 1930 and 1935, in rapid succession, the entire
stretch of territory known as South America, and the eleven Republics
occupying that continent, were incorporated into the United States of
the Americas. The State of Brazil was recognized by Congress in 1931,
and, on account of its large area, consisting of 3,209,878 square
miles, the new State was styled the &ldquo;Texas of the
South.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">During the last half of the nineteenth century the
burning issues caused by the <span class="marginnote">Old Wounds are
Healed Up.</span> Civil War were generally and vaguely characterized as
those which existed between the North and South. The question of State
sovereignty, slavery and the resultant Civil War, divided the North and
South into two vast, hostile camps. The fall of Richmond in 1865
terminated hostilities, it is true, but a bitter, relentless political
and social war was waged between these sections for over a quarter of a
century thereafter. The deep <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>wounds caused by the Civil War began
to slowly heal, but it required a foreign war to demonstrate to the
world that time at last had conquered all animosity, all the anguish
and bitterness of spirit that had existed between the North and
South.</p>
<p class="par">During our war with Spain from April 22, 1898, to
October 26, of the same year, Confederate generals who had taken
prominent parts in the Southern army, men who had led their hosts to
help tear into tatters the great Constitution of the United States,
unsheathed their swords once more, in 1898, and to their lasting honor,
this time it was in defense of that very Constitution. In 1898 the men
of the South eagerly followed the lead of Wheeler and Fitzhugh Lee and
sprang to arms in the defence of a united country. It was a most
impressive spectacle; one that filled the world with amazement and
America with patriotic joy.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999, that little strip of territory lying between
Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s line and the <span class="marginnote">No more
&ldquo;South&rdquo; in 1999.</span> gulf of Mexico was no longer known
or recognized as the South. The sceptre of the South had passed into
the keeping of the South American continent, which territory in 1999
had been divided into ten States of our great American Union, namely
the States of Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile, <span class=

<p class="par">The real and actual South of the United States of the
Americas, in 1999, consisted of the States above named, a vast sweep of
territory lying between the 10&deg; North and 55&deg; South of the
equator, embracing 8,207,688 square miles in area, with a population of
127,000,000 souls. In 1999 the State of Brazil alone had a population
of 42,000,000.</p>
<p class="par">The Middle States of the great American Republic in 1999
were those of Central America, namely the States of Costa Rica,
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">The Northern States of the great Republic in 1999
consisted of those states lying between Alaska and the Mexican gulf,
including the newly acquired States of East and West Canada. The
population of the Middle States in 1999 was estimated at 75,000,000,
while the census of the Northern States figured at 329,000,000. The
total population of the United States of the Americas in 1999, figured

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Cuba became part of the United States in 1910. The
direct cause of the war of 1898 was the blowing up of the Maine.
Through this premeditated and diabolical act, no less than 266 of our
brave American sailors were murdered in cold blood.</p>
<p class="par">The Madrid authorities were innocent parties to this
lamentable transaction and their representative in Havana,
Captain-General Blanco, has been acquitted of the heinous charge of
participation in that fearful piece of butchery. The guilty men, the
assassins who blew up the Maine on the night of the 15th of February,
1898, were Weylerites, whose chief, the infamous Gen. Weyler, had been
removed from office by the Sagasta government. To resent this slight
upon their chief; to embroil their home government in a war with the
United States, and to gratify their thirst for American blood, these
Weylerites, (who themselves located the mines in Havana harbor,)
watched their opportunity and exploded the mine that destroyed our
gallant vessel, hurling into eternity 266 of as brave men as ever trod
a deck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But the vengeance that was meted out to Spain for the
treachery of her murderous <span class="marginnote">The Maine was
Avenged.</span> sons, was sweeping and most complete in its character.
Our martyrs of the Maine have been avenged. Spain has learned along
with the rest of the nations, that America is slow to anger but swift
and terrible in her vengeance; from the punishment of Spain the world
has learned a Yankee lesson that will be remembered in all time to
come.</p>
<p class="par">Apart, however, from the castigation of Spain, America
had a duty to perform in the liberation of Cuba. From the date of the
arrival of the first shipload of Spaniards in 1492 to the departure of
the last load of Spanish officials and soldiers in 1899, Cuba had
rested under a cloud. Prosperity under Spanish rule, from Valesque in
1510 to Blanco in 1898, appeared to be an impossibility. From
Christopher Columbus to Admiral Cervera, the first and the last Spanish
navigators <span class="corr" id="xd21e398" title=
"Source: despatched">dispatched</span> by the crown of Spain to Cuba,
the life-blood of that fair isle had been wasted away. Its history may
fitly be written in blood. Such condition of affairs could not be
endured always at the threshold of a vast, liberty-loving Republic and
Cuba&rsquo;s loud appeals for aid stirred America to action. War was
declared after a formal demand upon Spain for the liberation of Cuba.
The result of the war of 1898 was that Spain stood up to the front just
long enough to get kicked into tatters. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the 1st day of January, 1902, the military occupation
of Cuba by the troops <span class="marginnote">A Civil War in
Cuba.</span> of the United States terminated and the government passed
into the keeping of the Cubans. The Cuban government, under President
Gomez, was beset with difficulties from the start. It was found
difficult to bridle and keep down jealousies and partisan feelings
among the Cubans themselves. They appeared to detest one another under
their native government as cordially as they did their former
task-masters, the Spaniards. As soon as the Cubans established their
own government, love of country vanished from among them; there
appeared to be no unity of purpose.</p>
<p class="par">In 1907 a civil war broke out in the fair but
unfortunate isle, and during the summer of that year the terrible
scenes of the last struggle with Spain, under Weyler, were again
re-enacted. During that year and the two following years of
1908&ndash;09, the gleaming machette once again performed its deadly
work.</p>
<p class="par">This fratricidal war came to an end early in 1910, when
the Cubans by a plebicite, or popular vote, rendered an almost
unanimous vote in favor of the annexation of Cuba to the United States.
This important decision was ratified by Congress and received the
official signature of President George Dewey, the hero of Manila, at
noon on the 24th day of December, 1910. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">It was the first gun of the Raleigh, fired in
Manila bay at dawn on the first day of May, 1898, that sounded the
keynote of America&rsquo;s future greatness. The echo of that gun had
not died out even in 1999. It still rang amidst the nations of the
earth, reverberating across its seas and continents. It was the signal
that sounded the dawn of</p>
<p class="par"><i>The United States of the Americas</i>, a mighty
Republic, which, in the year 1999, embraced every square foot of land
in the Western Hemisphere, from the snow-clad huts of the Esquimos to
the rock-ribbed straits of Magellan, with its teeming, hustling
population of 531,000,000 souls. Uncle Samuel was boss of the ranch,
from its Patagonian cellar clear to its roof in the Arctic region. With
its mighty talons <span class="marginnote">The Great Bird of

pointing into the Atlantic, far beyond Porto Rico; with its
tail-feathers covering the expanse of the Pacific, clear into the

to behold, as its mighty wings spread from the North to the South Pole.
And Dewey&rsquo;s guns did it.</p>
<p class="par">At critical periods the fate of nations, as well as of
individuals, seems to suspend by a single, slender thread. At such
moments, so keenly poised are the balances of fate, that a mere breath
may disturb them. Admiral Dewey, the idol of America, unknowingly, held
the fate of a vast Republic in the hollow of his hand. He knew it not;
America knew it not. But in the light of events in 1999 such proved to
be the case. Had he failed; had his brave squadron been annihilated by
treacherous mines in Manila bay; had our American fleet been destroyed
at Cavit&eacute;, instead of Montojo&rsquo;s squadron, the Dream of the
United States of the Americas would not have been realized in 1999.</p>
<p class="par">But America is unconquerable; and Dewey won. When, on
the 24th day of April, 1898, the momentous message flashed across sea
and continent to Dewey, ordering him to &ldquo;sink or capture&rdquo;
the Spanish squadron, the American Eagle gave its first shrill cry of
defiance. Every man on the American fleet off Hong Kong swelled with
pride from Commodore Dewey to the humblest powder-monkey. Theirs was a
mission to feel proud of, and when Dewey&rsquo;s six warships sailed

lay down his life in the cause of our noble country.</p>
<p class="par">These were the men with cool heads and unflinching
bravery who first encountered the Spanish hosts<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e442" title="Not in source">.</span> These were the men who
electrified a whole world by the splendor of their matchless victory.
The word gratitude is a feeble one indeed to adequately express the
feelings of the American people when the truth became known. At first
it seemed incredible that such a brilliant stroke could have been
accomplished in less than ten days after the declaration of war. In
1999 men occasionally referred to Trafalgar and the battle of the Nile,
Farragut&rsquo;s heroism at Mobile bay, the encounter of those two
little scorpions, the Monitor and Merrimac, and other naval
engagements, as matters of history, but the peerless American victory
at Manila bay, the praises of the one and only Dewey and his brave men,
were still, in that year, the theme on every tongue.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 it was reckoned a high distinction for any
American to be able to say that his father, brother or relative took
part in the great victory at Manila. Indeed, there still lived in 1999,
in the State of Brazil, an extremely old man, aged 115 years, who took
part in the gallant fight off Cavit&eacute; in 1898.</p>
<p class="par">When Dewey&rsquo;s squadron left Mirs bay to proceed
upon its eventful voyage to Manila, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>Earl Stanley, at that time a
stripling of fourteen years, hid in an empty hogshead <span class=
"marginnote">A Plucky Little American Lad.</span> in the hold of the
warship Boston, just as the American fleet was weighing anchor. When
the mountains about Mirs bay and the Chinese mainland had disappeared
from the sight of the squadron, Stanley, the young stowaway, emerged
from his retreat and soon after landed in the arms of a marine, who
brought the lad before the Captain. That official was at first inclined
to deal severely with the young culprit. The latter, however, was
straightforward and fearless in his bearing. He plainly told the
Captain that he stole his way on board the Boston to share in the fight
and he was ready to do anything to fight under the Stars and Stripes.
The Captain, though outwardly severe, secretly admired the lad&rsquo;s
pluck and turned him over to the charge of a gun-crew. In 1999 Earl
Stanley resided in Rio Janeiro, and for over sixty years had been
drawing a monthly pension of $35 from the government. He was in that
year the sole survivor of the battle of Manila, an exclusive
distinction he had already enjoyed for many long years.</p>
<p class="par">Aside from the sweeping results of the action off
Cavit&eacute;, Admiral Dewey&rsquo;s firm and resolute attitude towards
Aguinaldo and his mercenaries, as well as his open defiance to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>the German squadron, gave the keenest satisfaction
throughout the United States.</p>
<p class="par">As early as the year 1902, the fact, long suspected, was
at last officially confirmed, that before the declaration of war in
1898 <span class="marginnote">Spain failed to deliver the Goods.</span>
between Spain and America, there existed a firmly established secret
alliance between Spain and Germany. Spain had bartered with Germany for
her active support in her war against the Yankees. In compensation for
her aid and countenance, Spain had agreed to cede over to Germany, in
fee simple, the entire group of Philippine islands. After Dewey&rsquo;s
matchless victory of the 1st of May, Germany slipped on her
&ldquo;thinking cap&rdquo; and experienced an exceedingly sudden change
of mind. Her &ldquo;aid&rdquo; in the Spanish cause was not worth a
baby&rsquo;s rattle. As to the German &ldquo;countenance,&rdquo; it
looked so crest-fallen and hopelessly sour that Spain as she gazed upon
it refused to be comforted.</p>
<p class="par">But, notwithstanding this, with an impudence that was
positively refreshing to contemplate, after the battle of Manila,
Germany put up a fine game of bluff and acted as though she held a
proprietary interest in the Philippines. The German government
dispatched a fleet of seven war vessels to Manila bay, under command of
Admiral von Diederichs, under a flimsy pretext of &ldquo;protecting
German interests.&rdquo; In reality it was intended by the presence of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>this German squadron in Manila bay to annoy,
bulldoze, and if possible to intimidate Commodore Dewey.</p>
<p class="par">For six weeks after the battle of Manila, Dewey&rsquo;s
fleet as a result of the fight, was <span class="marginnote">Little
Powder but lots of Pluck.</span> low in its ammunition and coal
supplies. There was one very important fighting factor however, that
never ran short on the American fleet, as that was the indomitable
pluck and fighting mettle of Dewey and his men. Dewey diplomatically
tolerated some of the petty annoyances offered at that time by the
Germans, but they were given by the brave American commander to
distinctly understand that there existed a danger-line which once
crossed, would bring death and hospitals in its wake. None knew better
than the German Admiral that the practice of lighting matches around
powder magazines is a very unhealthy one.</p>
<p class="par">Admiral Von Diederichs bluffed around with his squadron,
but with a wisdom that Solomon himself might have envied, he gave
Dewey&rsquo;s danger-line a wide berth. It was only when Admiral Dewey
sent his famous request to the Department for the Oregon, &ldquo;for
political reasons,&rdquo; that the German fleet in Manila bay suddenly
discovered that they had some urgent business elsewhere, and made a
very hasty exit from the unhealthy neighborhood of an American Admiral
who had a mind of his own and a fine lot of lads to back up his
opinion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">Centennial Celebration of Manila<br>
1998.</span></h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">America never surrenders, and that is one reason
why we hold on to the Philippines. Grand Celebration of the Dewey
Centennial throughout the Americas.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the year 1999 the American possession of the
Philippine islands was regarded throughout the United States of the
Americas as a master stroke. Statesmen in that year asked themselves
how the Americas could have ever developed their enormous Asiatic
commerce, without having a <i lang="fr">point d&rsquo;appui</i>, or
base of operations, in Oriental waters?</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1899 Christendom (and Heathendom, as well,)
beheld with amazement the carving up of China by the greedy vultures of
Europe. In that year of her interminable history, China resembled a
huge, helpless jelly-fish, attacked on every side by the sword-fishes
of Europe. While this interesting process of China-carving was in full
operation, America, as a result of Dewey&rsquo;s victory, discovered
that a pearl <span class="marginnote">The Philippines in 1999.</span>
of rare value had fallen into her lap. When Dewey entered Manila bay on
the ever memorable morn of May 1st, 1898, he had not so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>much as
a hitching-post to fasten the painter (rope) of his smallest launch.
But, before the setting of the sun on that day, he had laid low a whole
empire under the keels of his squadron. There lived not a solitary
European Admiral of the period of 1898 who would not have given his
right arm to have been in Dewey&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 it appeared incredible that one year only after
the battle of Manila there were men (earnest and well-meaning patriots,
many of them,) who were strenuously opposed to the retention of those
islands by the United States of America. It was difficult, in the
twentieth century, to conceive how short-sighted, how unmindful of our
country&rsquo;s glorious future, were those so-called
anti-expansionists.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 the argument was clear and indisputable that
America in 1898 had not waged a wanton war for conquest. It was a
necessity of war that brought about the destruction of the Manila wing
of the Spanish fleet, and the city was captured subsequently as an act
of self-defense. It became <span class="marginnote">Rocked in the
Cradle of the Deep.</span> a measure of necessity to &ldquo;put to
sleep&rdquo; every Spanish gun afloat in the Pacific. Had Dewey allowed
any of these sea-hounds to escape and prey upon American commerce in
that ocean, what would have become of our merchant shipping in the
Pacific? Our finest steamships would have been at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>the
mercy of the most contemptible Spanish privateer. Hundreds of precious
lives and American shipping, representing millions of dollars, must
have been destroyed by the pirates of the red and yellow flag. But
Dewey put them all to sleep and rocked them in the cradle of the
deep.</p>
<p class="par">This deed of self-defence accomplished, then what? Ought
Dewey to have vacated Manila bay and made a laughing-stock of himself
or stand his ground and bring the fight with Spain to a finish? There
can be but one patriotic answer to this question.</p>
<p class="par">Dewey stood his ground, and in 1899 public opinion
throughout the world divided itself into two great camps&mdash;those
who openly and others who secretly admired the brave American
Admiral.</p>
<p class="par">On the 1st day of May, 1998 the Centennial anniversary
of the battle of Manila was celebrated with a volcanic display of
intense enthusiasm throughout the United States of the Americas. It was
&ldquo;Dewey Day&rdquo; from the State of Alaska clear south to the
State <span class="marginnote">Equal to the 4th of July.</span> of
Patagonia. The seals in Baffin&rsquo;s bay wore an extra smile, while
the albatross and other gulls at the Horn circled about and fluttered
as though something uncommon was on.</p>
<p class="par">Every city in the vast Republic was in gala attire to
honor the glorious memories of the day. In Washington, (Mexico,) and at
the capitals of each of the eighty-five <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>States of the Americas
the Manila Centennial was signalized with a patriotic enthusiasm seldom
equaled but never eclipsed.</p>
<p class="par">The celebration of the Centennial anniversary of
Waterloo by the old allied nations of Europe in 1915 proved a very
brilliant affair, one which dazzled the world by its magnificence and
regal splendor. But the Manila Centennial in 1998 relegated the
Waterloo episode entirely in the shade. The only American national
celebration of the twentieth century that might compare with it was the
Bi-Centennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence on the 4th
day of July, 1976.</p>
<p class="par">The Manila Centennial in 1998 celebrated what was
universally regarded as the pivotal <span class="marginnote">Turning
Point of American History<span class="corr" id="xd21e528" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> or turning point in American History.
From the date of that battle in 1898 the supremacy of the United States
became established as a first-grade power. Its prowess in war and
triumphs in the arts of peace were universally recognized. Little then
is it to be wondered at that the American Colossus in 1998 seethed with
patriotic fervor on the 1st day of May of the Manila Centennial
anniversary.</p>
<p class="par">The preparations for the great event had been under way
for nearly a year. It was clearly remembered in 1998 that, although
Bunker Hill was an insignificant fight from a military point of view,
yet it was a glorious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"
name="pb34">34</a>]</span>battle for America from the fact that it
proved a turning point in our nation&rsquo;s history. So it proved with
the battle of Manila. It was a turning point in our national history
that demanded a fitting celebration of its centennial anniversary.</p>
<p class="par">In 1998 the President of the United States of the
Americas was Vernon R. <span class="marginnote">A Chip of the Old
Block.</span> Schley, a grandson of the famous Admiral who annihilated
Cervera&rsquo;s fleet on the <span class="corr" id="xd21e540" title=
"Source: 3d">3rd</span> day of July, 1898, while the commander-in-chief
was inconveniently away on some other errand. Upon President Schley
devolved the high honor, but irksome and difficult task, of firing at
sunrise a salute of <span class="corr" id="xd21e543" title=
"Source: aerial">&aelig;rial</span> torpedoes in the capitals of every
State in the vast American Republic, and, at the same moment, from his
private office in the Capitol building in Washington, Mexico, the
President unfurled the American flag on the dome of every State house
in the Americas.</p>
<p class="par">This, of course, was accomplished by means of
electricity. At first thought it might appear to be a very easy task to
press a button in the State of Mexico and fire off <span class="corr"
id="xd21e548" title="Source: aerial">&aelig;rial</span> torpedoes in
the States of Alaska, the Canadas, Peru, Patagonia, <span class="corr"
id="xd21e551" title="Source: Argentine">Argentina</span>, Venezuela,
Bolivia and Brazil at the same instant, extending the salutes to the
Middle American States of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Salvador, Guatemala,
but as a matter of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>fact, the task of the President was by no
means an easy one.</p>
<p class="par">On the Manila Centennial anniversary day President
Schley required nearly three <span class="marginnote">Going Around with
the Sun.</span> hours of constant work to fire the national salutes
from the Eastern to the Western Capitals of the great Republic at
exactly sunrise in each city on the 1st day of May, 1998. The sun arose
on the Eastern Capitals of the New England States that morning at 5:32
<span class="sc">A. M.</span> in Hartford, Boston, Montpelier and other
cities, but it was nearly 8:43 <span class="sc">A. M.</span> before the
President could fire off the <span class="corr" id="xd21e567" title=
"Source: aerial">&aelig;rial</span> torpedoes over the Golden Gate,
unfurling at the same moment Old Glory, which waved to the morning
breezes of the broad Pacific.</p>
<p class="par">All those States of the Americas, from Canada to
Patagonia that are on the same degree of longitude received their
signals from the President at about the same time. The most easterly
city of the American Union in 1999 was Rio Janeiro, situate on the
40&deg; longitude. The torpedo salutes were first fired there in honor
of the great Centennial. The next city that saluted was Montevideo.
Buenos Ayres next followed. Boston, Mass., Caracas in the State of
Venezuela and Bogota in the State of Colombia were next &ldquo;touched
off&rdquo; by President Schley, and so in the course of the rising sun
each American city saluted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>the glorious day. When this feature
of the 1998 centennial program was explained to a Frenchman on the 1st
day of May of that year, he shrugged his shoulders as only a Frenchman
can, exclaiming: &ldquo;Mon Dieu, vhy don&rsquo;t zey fire a salute in
zee sun,&mdash;parbleu.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In this vast aggregation of eighty-five States the Dewey
Centennial celebration was everywhere observed with marked enthusiasm,
but the style of the celebration differed widely, according to the
section or location of the State in which it was held. <span class=
"marginnote">Different Ways of Celebrating.</span> Throughout Alaska
and the two Canadian States and the northern belt of States, military
pageants, naval parades, athletic sports, orations, concerts and
banquets predominated.</p>
<p class="par">In the tropical or Central American States, high mass
was celebrated in all the cathedrals and churches in Mexico, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica, and the day was given to
feasting and dancing. Throughout the southern sections of the United
States of the Americas, in Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and contiguous
States, the <span lang="la">Te Deum</span> was chanted in all the
principal churches and high mass was celebrated with a pomp and
magnificence that appeals so irresistibly to the heart of the Latin
race. In each State of the Americas ample appropriations had been voted
from State funds to meet the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>expenses of the great day. Not a
family in the colossal American Republic of 500,000,000 souls lacked on
that day for a feast of the choicest delicacies, with a carte blanche
of wines of the most grateful and generous vintage.</p>
<p class="par">On the occasion of the Manila Centennial in 1999
Englishmen were accorded the seat of honor at every table in the
Americas and the health of King Alexander II, who in 1999 wielded the
sceptre of Great Britain, was tossed off with gusto and enthusiasm by
every living American. England&rsquo;s true and sterling friendship to
America in 1898 was still vividly remembered in 1998. The strong grasp
of her hand at a critical period in 1898, when her attitude became a
matter of vital importance to America, was still cordially
appreciated.</p>
<p class="par">Every American Governor in the South American States as
well as those of Central and North America, gave a sumptuous banquet in
honor of the day. At Rio Janeiro Gov. Day entertained no less than
9,000 at his festive tables. Gov. Horace K. Depew, a grandson of the
Senator and ex-railroad magnate, entertained 30,000 guests in
Washington, (Mexico). In splendor, elegance and lavish hospitality even
the chronicles of the Middle Ages could furnish no parallel. Gov.
Depew&rsquo;s guests were banqueted and f&ecirc;ted in one of
Montezuma&rsquo;s old palaces which still retained much of its
architectural beauty and was rich in the memories of a glorious past.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">High mass was celebrated in the cathedral of Mexico.
Gov. Depew and a brilliant staff attended the services. All public
edifices <span class="marginnote">Celebrating in Mexico.</span> and
private houses were profusely decorated with garlands and festoons of
beautiful tropical flowers of the most gorgeous dyes. Massive arches,
embellished with medallions of Dewey, were erected on all the principal
streets and avenues. These were made of verdant boughs, intertwined
with the choicest floral creations of the tropics. Martial music and a
constant firing of <span class="corr" id="xd21e597" title=
"Source: aerial">&aelig;rial</span> torpedoes kept public interest at
its keenest edge, from dawn to night. These festive scenes in the State
of Mexico were re-enacted all over the Americas on the 1st day of May,
1998. The Dewey or Manila Centennial was a tribute to the memory of the
man who at Manila bay, electrified the world and laid the corner stone
of the United States of the Americas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">If the reader is an American, the question will
naturally arise, what became of our transatlantic cousins in the
&ldquo;right tight little island&rdquo; in the year 1999? In what light
was the stupendous fabric of the United States of the Americas regarded
by England in that year? Did England view with friendliness and
complacency the development of the American Colossus? Surely the
awakening of the Americas, both politically and industrially, must have
seriously challenged the attention of England. Was England in 1999 the
same powerful, cordial friend of America that she so well proved
herself to be in 1898?</p>
<p class="par">During the year 1899 Admiral Seymour of the British
Navy, while cruising in Asiatic waters, paid Admiral Dewey a visit on
the Olympia. His parting words to the American Admiral were:
&ldquo;Your victory at Cavit&eacute; was also our victory.&rdquo; No
words could better express the fraternal and cordial relations existing
in 1899 between England and America and the Dreamer feels <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>proud
and happy to say that in 1999 these cordial relations were still in
full force. Providence, it would appear, had selected these two great
nations to act as leaders and standard-bearers among the peoples of the
earth. Their spheres of action in 1999 did not clash, hence no jealousy
existed between the two nations.</p>
<p class="par">In 1899 America, while perfectly friendly to England and
proud to be her ally, was reluctant to enter into an offensive and
defensive alliance with her. The spirit of American independence,
always self-reliant, was slow and exceedingly cautious in the matter of
&ldquo;entangling alliances.&rdquo; The only alliance possible would be
one with England, which nation is the parent of the Anglo-Saxon
race.</p>
<p class="par">England&rsquo;s wise and friendly course during the
Spanish-American war, had filled the <span class="marginnote">England
our Firm Friend.</span> heart of every true American patriot with
gratitude. By her sagacious action the unpleasant memories of 1776,
1812 and the Alabama episode, had been entirely obliterated, root and
branch, from every American breast.</p>
<p class="par">Before the outbreak of hostilities in 1898, which
culminated in the Yanko-Spanko war, there existed between France,
Germany and Spain a secret, yet none the less tacit understanding, that
in the event of war, the two powers first named would come forward to
the assistance of Spain as against the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>cordially detested
Yankees. France held the bulk of Spanish securities and was vitally
interested in the issue of the conflict between Spain and America. The
success of the Spanish cause or its disaster, signified either the gain
or loss of millions of Spanish securities. Her sympathies, therefore,
were given over to Spain and the French government and people were
quite ready to expend chilled steel and smokeless powder against the
bulwarks of America.</p>
<p class="par">Germany, on the other hand, in her self-assumed
<span class="corr" id="xd21e629" title=
"Source: r&ograve;le">r&ocirc;le</span> of general meddler-in-chief of
<span class="marginnote">Spain&rsquo;s Two Great and Good
Friends.</span> the so-styled &ldquo;European concert,&rdquo; was
spoiling for a fight with a country that had taken from her hundreds of
thousands of her best citizens and whose industrial expansion was a
thorn in her side.</p>
<p class="par">For the first time since 1870, when the French tri-color
was humbled in the dust of Sedan, Germany and France were interested in
a common cause against America, and were actuated by the same selfish
motives against the American Republic. Both were ready in April, 1898,
to fly at America&rsquo;s throat and in unison with Spain, administer
to our American Republic a first-class thrashing. These two worthies
entertained the notion that the great American Republic would very soon
be humbled and be only too glad to sue for peace on bended knees.</p>
<p class="par">In return for her valuable services in this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>delightful program, Germany was to be rewarded by
Spain with the gift outright of the Philippine islands. This was the
beautiful cluster of grapes which tempted the cupidity of the German
fox.</p>
<p class="par">But, alas, in the language of the lamented Josh
Billings, &ldquo;nothing is more certain than the uncertainty of this
world.&rdquo; France and Germany, (an ill-assorted and graceless pair,)
had reckoned without their host.</p>
<p class="par">Sorely against their wishes, with hat in hand, France
and Germany found themselves under the absolute necessity of calling at
the office of a certain pugnacious and only too well known gentleman by
the name of John Bull, whose home since the days of the Druids and
William the Bastard has been in the snug little island of England and
whose postoffice address is London.</p>
<p class="par">They (F. and G.) came to consult John Bull on the very
important subject of their proposed expedition against America, with
Spain acting as a tail to their kite.</p>
<p class="par">They explained to Mr. Bull the object of their mission;
they set forth in a very clear <span class="marginnote">A Very Anxious
Pair.</span> light that Uncle Sam, on the other side of the Atlantic,
needed a sound thrashing, and what was more, needed it very badly.
France and Germany posed before J. B. as champions of a weaker nation
that they were both very anxious to protect. They represented that they
had no possible interest in the outcome <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>of a war between America
and Spain. All they asked of England was merely to remain
neutral,&mdash;to keep quiet while the three prize stars, France,
Germany and Spain, proceeded to give Uncle Sam a taste of their
raw-hides.</p>
<p class="par">Then it was that the British Lion gave a roar, and in
clear, unmistakable language informed both France and Germany if they
ventured to fire a gun against America in the defence of Spain, England
would not remain neutral, but would side with America and lend her
assistance on sea and land.</p>
<p class="par">The British Lion is not to be trifled with. France and
Germany knew this only too well, and when the war broke out they
decided to remain home and wisely stay in doors while it
rained<span class="corr" id="xd21e659" title="Not in source">.</span>
Spain went to war alone with her powerful enemy and took her medicine,
we were nearly tempted to say, &ldquo;like a good little
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The era of fraternal love, inaugurated through
England&rsquo;s wise action in repulsing the advances of France and
Germany, proved the keystone to the greatness of America and England in
1999. Ever after the Spanish-American war they remained loyal and true
to one another and their friendship and mutual interests ever increased
thereafter. Throughout the twentieth century England and America stood
side by side in every emergency. It was not necessary to draw up legal
documents with enormous seals and yards of red silk <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>ribbon
to cement the alliance of true friendship that existed between the two
nations. Their hearts beat in unison in the common cause of humanity.
In the twentieth century England and America were invincible in war and
leaders in all arts of peace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=

<p class="par first">Having clearly set forth in our earlier chapters
the splendid proportions and the commanding position on this globe held
by the United States of the Americas in 1999, it now becomes necessary
in order to determine the position of the great American Republic in
its international relations, to review, in brief, the condition of
Europe, and, more particularly that of England, in the twentieth
century.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1999 the British and American flags
protected over one-half of the human family and before the close of the
twenty-first century it appeared certain that English would become the
universal language. The population of the world in 1999 figured at a
trifle over 2,000,000,000 souls. The population of the United States of
the Americas in 1999 was rated at 531,000,000, while that of the
British possessions figured at about an equal amount, making a grand
total population of over 1,000,000,000 people under the flags of the
two nations. It is easy to comprehend how, under two thoroughly
enlightened governments, <span class="marginnote">English the Universal
Language.</span> with a good system of education, free schools, and an
enterprising press, English rapidly came to the front as the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>universal language, and in the year 1999 it became
obvious and clear to all candid minds that the Anglo-Saxon race already
dominated the world.</p>
<p class="par">The Arbitration Treaty between England and America was
signed on the 6th day of June 1910. By the provisions of this document
it was agreed that in the event of any dispute between the two
countries Arbitration as a settlement for all difficulties would be
resorted to. Public opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was sternly
opposed to any resort to war between England and the Americas. The
Arbitration Treaty was signed by her gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria,
who was still seated on the British throne and was enjoying a fair
measure of health in 1910 at the venerable age of 92 years. This
marvelous and well-preserved lady still retained the homage and respect
of the entire world, and the indications pointed to a grand celebration
of her Majesty&rsquo;s centennial anniversary in 1918. But the world
was denied that privilege and honor. In the year 1912, the Duke of
York, (Victoria&rsquo;s grandson,) succeeded to the British throne,
assuming the title of Alexander I.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 radical changes had taken place in the map of
Europe. The long international <span class="marginnote">France Gobbled
Up by Germany.</span> feud and bitterness existing between France and
Germany had been twice weighed in the scales of war. The wound caused
to French <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>national pride by the fall of Sedan, Metz and
Paris, rancored long in the breasts of all Frenchmen. It was a grief
silently borne, but none the less keen. In 1907 the French military
party again shouted the battle cry, &ldquo;A Berlin,&rdquo; and in the
brief but disastrous war that followed again were the proud eagles of
France trailed in the dust. France lost more of her territory in the
Franco-German war of 1907 and Germany saddled on her an enormous war
indemnity in the shape of $3,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="par">This was a hard blow to French national pride. Russia,
her ally, proved false to her promises of aid and France was left alone
to determine the issue with Germany.</p>
<p class="par">The terrible disaster of 1907 only added oil to the
French fire of hatred, and in 1935 France, for some imaginary cause,
again entered into another war of revenge, (guerre de revanche,)
against Germany. As a result of the war of 1935 France utterly
collapsed. At the close of that war Germany took possession of Paris
and maintained German garrisons in all of the forts surrounding that
city for a period of <span class="marginnote">Germans Hold Paris for
Ten Years.</span> ten years, or until the year 1945. Germany
determined, while holding possession of Paris, to reduce the enormous
military establishment of France, the maintenance of which had greatly
impoverished both countries. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>order to suppress and crush
France, German garrisons were maintained in every province of France.
In this manner Germany kept her mailed grasp upon France, ready at any
moment to stifle her upon the least show of resistance. In 1999 France
became practically reduced to the condition of a German province.</p>
<p class="par">Those who lived in the year 1899 will recollect only too
well the crying injustice <span class="marginnote">The Wrongs of Poor
Dreyfus.</span> perpetrated upon the person of an innocent French
officer, Dreyfus, who suffered and was humiliated in a manner which,
fortunately, seldom falls to the lot of man. France&rsquo;s lack of
moral courage to grant justice to Capt. Dreyfus for so many years,
proved to the world that &ldquo;la belle France,&rdquo; after all, was
merely a Dead Sea apple,&mdash;beautiful to the eye but rotten to the
core.</p>
<p class="par">It is then no cause for surprise that France, the moral
coward, in 1935, had been transformed into a German province.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 Spain and Turkey had both been carved up,
banqueted upon and digested by <span class="marginnote">Adieu Spain and
Turkey.</span> the political cannibals of Europe. In the partition that
took place in the twentieth century England had been careful to secure
for herself some of Spain&rsquo;s choice side-cuts and joints and also
secured her slice of Turkey.</p>
<p class="par">Turkey had been an invalid for many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>long
years, and its obliteration from the map of Europe was merely a
question of time. These semi-civilized and blood-thirsty Turks with a
hideous history drenched in innocent blood, champions of lust and
rapine, oppressors of Armenia and violators of chastity, were finally
driven out of Europe in 1920, hurled back once more into the dens of
Asia Minor from whence they came.</p>
<p class="par">Russia had long held a first mortgage upon the Turkish
vagabond&rsquo;s estate in Europe and possessed herself of a large
share of the vacated territory. But Russia, strange to relate, was kept
out of Constantinople in 1999. England, Germany, and what was left of
France, as well as Italy, were still fully determined that Russia
should never command the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. The European
Powers were ready, as of old, to smash Russia and defeat her ambition
in that direction. They knew only too well that once firmly
<span class="marginnote">Shut Out of Constantinople.</span> planted in
the Ottoman capital Russia would then become the absolute master of
Europe. In 1999 the Turkish territory about Constantinople, on both
banks of the Bosphorus, was recognized as a neutral zone and was held
in trust by the united nations of Europe. No war vessels were permitted
to anchor in the Dardanelles under any pretence whatsoever.

the compact. The penalty is extermination from the face of the
earth.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Spain, in 1999, was reduced to a mere geographical
quantity. Ever after the Spanish unpleasantness with America, in 1898,
Spain&rsquo;s unhappy history had been sliding down a greased pole.
From the moment that Columbus discovered America, Spain became a
spoiled child of fortune.</p>
<p class="par">In 1492 Spain had a population of 40,000,000
people,&mdash;frugal, industrious and prosperous. In the arts and
sciences they led the world in those days. In military science and
navigation none could equal them. The discovery of America utterly
ruined Spain in less than three hundred years. Spaniards thereafter
ceased to depend upon their own energy and resources. Intoxicated by
the brilliant discoveries of Columbus, the dazzling conquests of
Pizarro, Cortes and De Soto, Spain has endeavored since the fifteenth
century to enslave the New World and live upon the sweat of
others&rsquo; brows. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The acquisition of sudden and prodigious wealth in the
New World; the steady flow <span class="marginnote">The Dangers of
Sudden Wealth.</span> of money brought into Spain by slave labor; the
luxury and voluptuous ease of life thus engendered, form important
factors in the history of Spain&rsquo;s decline. After losing all of
her vast possessions in the New World, it was left to America in 1898
to give the Spaniards their coup-de-gr&acirc;ce and check their baggage
for Madrid.</p>
<p class="par">In 1942 Spain ceased to possess a government of her own.
After a devastating war, (<span lang="fr">une guerre &agrave;
l&rsquo;outrance</span>,) Spain ended her official existence and was
parcelled out among the European nations. England, with Gibraltar to
start with, secured a generous slice of the Spanish booty. In the
twentieth century England was still well inclined to make the best
possible use of her opportunities, and America was always glad to
advance her cause, whenever it was practicable to do so.</p>
<p class="par">The annihilation of Spain came about after the following
manner:</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1917 the world rejoiced at the prospect of a
permanent solution of the war problem. The new devices invented and
perfected by the deviltry of man, to be employed in the destruction of
his fellow men, had reached in that year such a degree of perfection
that war simply meant the wholesale destruction or total annihilation
of those who engaged in it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1917 <span class="corr" id="xd21e760" title=
"Source: aerial">&aelig;rial</span> navigation was practically solved,
and a new and vast element had <span class="marginnote">A New Element
in War.</span> opened its possibilities to the will of man. At the
close of the nineteenth century the &ldquo;blue etherial&rdquo; was
wholly unobstructed in its vast extent and still defied the skill of
our best inventors. Prof. Langley and his disciples had not yet solved
the great question of &aelig;rial navigation. In 1899 this most
inviting and ever tempting field of research still remained an unsolved
mystery. The old fashioned balloon, with no will or control of its own,
subject to the whim or caprice of every breath of air, was the best
apology we could offer in 1899 for purposes of &aelig;rial
navigation.</p>
<p class="par">In 1917 the problem of &aelig;rial navigation had been
practically solved by Tesla, in <span class="marginnote">&AElig;rial
Navigation Perfected.</span> whose brain many profound secrets of
nature had long been harbored. With the aid and potentiality of
electricity, (the slave of the twentieth century), &aelig;rial
navigation had been perfected. One of the first devices invented for
use in the air was the &aelig;rial warship, operated and controlled by
electricity.</p>
<p class="par">Loaded with a quarter ton of dynamite, these deadly
warships, without anyone to navigate them could be made to hover over a
city and threaten its population <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>with total annihilation. They
were popularly called &ldquo;death angels.&rdquo; The sight of one of
the warships blanched the cheeks of the most intrepid, filling the city
or town over which it hovered with utmost consternation.</p>
<p class="par">The human mind recoiled with horror at the thought of
war with such fearful engines <span class="marginnote">Simply Wholesale
Murder.</span> of destruction. In fact war carried on with &aelig;rial
dynamite ships was no longer worthy of being called by that dignified
name, it was simply a wholesale destruction of lives and property. With
strange inconsistency, the world in 1917 appeared to be willing to wage
war on the &ldquo;retail plan.&rdquo; It was apparently willing to
sacrifice human beings in terrible battles fought between powerfully
armed vessels, with heavy rifles and rapid firing guns. The world was
willing to slaughter life by one method, yet it held in abhorrence
these &ldquo;death angels,&rdquo; which accomplished a wholesale
instead of a retail destruction of life and property. With an
inconsistency peculiarly its own, the world in 1917 appeared quite
willing that 50,000 men should be destroyed in a single battle by
rapid-firing guns, which could mow down a whole regiment at a time, but
the proposition to destroy an army of 50,000 men with one of the deadly
&aelig;rial warships, was everywhere regarded with horror. By this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>decision the world placed itself in the position
of a man who was willing to be killed by the shot of a six-inch rifle,
yet strongly objected on the score of humanity to being riddled by the
shell of a 14-inch rifle.</p>
<p class="par">War at best is but a relic of barbarism, and, be it
waged with &aelig;rial warships, or submarine torpedoes, with Mauser
rifles or smooth bore guns, it accomplishes the same end; nations are
plunged into ruin; the family circle is broken; widows and orphans are
left disconsolate.</p>
<p class="par">Be this as it may, in the year 1924, a Congress of the
leading nations was held in the city of Washington, (then situated in
the State of Mexico,) and, as a result of its deliberations a solemn
compact was entered into, signed by the Ambassadors of every civilized
nation, and a treaty of the most <span class="marginnote">&AElig;rial
War Ships Prohibited.</span> binding character was ratified, in which
it was stipulated that under no conditions, named or unnamed, would the
use of &aelig;rial warships ever be permitted as an instrument or
medium for waging war among nations.</p>
<p class="par">It was furthermore agreed and stipulated between these
nations that if, at any future period, any nation on the habitable
globe should ever permit itself to employ a system of &aelig;rial
warships for the prosecution of war, the other signatories of the
treaty would make common cause and combine in an attack against the
offender. They would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>proceed to invade its territory, destroy its
cities and monuments, lay waste its plains, obliterate its flag and
name from the family of nations. The remaining property of the violator
of the treaty must also be seized and sold, the proceeds to be donated
to charitable deeds.</p>
<p class="par">It was further stipulated between the signatory powers
that the punishment meted out to any violator of this solemn treaty
would be in the same kind as its offending. In other words, a nation
that employed the use of &aelig;rial warships and practiced the
horrible system of dropping from great heights heavy charges of high
explosives upon cities, fleets or shipping, would be wiped out from the
face of the earth and annihilated by the same methods of
destruction.</p>
<p class="par">The first violator of the Washington Treaty of 1924
proved to be Spain, the <span class="marginnote">A Bad Rascal
Caught.</span> ancient home and abiding-place of the Holy Inquisition,
that reprobate among nations; the emaciated and wasted offspring of
priestcraft. To her in 1930 was meted out the condign punishment which
she richly deserved for her flagrant violation of the Washington Treaty
in prosecuting her war against Morocco. During this war, in the year
1929, Spain had resorted to the use of &aelig;rial warships and by
employing a fleet of &ldquo;death angels,&rdquo; she had utterly
destroyed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>ancient city of Fez, the capital of that barbaric
North African State, reducing the city into a heap of ruins and causing
the slaughter, in less than thirty minutes, of over 175,000 people.
Tangier, on the northern boundary of Morocco, a city of 75,000
population, had also suffered the same fate from the Spanish
&ldquo;death angels.&rdquo; Tangier, with its inhabitants, was reduced
to ashes in less than ten minutes.</p>
<p class="par">In order to chastise Spain for her wanton cruelty and
open violation of the international convention of 1924, a peremptory
note was served upon the Madrid authorities, signed by the Treaty
Powers, with the names of America and England at the head of the list.
It was particularly observed that the signature of the United States of
the Americas was underscored, as though to remind Spain that America
had not forgotten the wrongs of Cuba.</p>
<p class="par">On the 21st day of April, 1930, (just thirty-two years
after the declaration of our <span class="marginnote">Hoisting the
Storm-signal.</span> first war with Spain,) notice was served upon the
Madrid authorities that within thirty days from date, the allied
nations of the world would mobilize their &aelig;rial war fleets and
proceed to devastate Spanish territory. This ultimatum included Ceuta,
the Balearic islands, as well as the ever-faithful isles of the
Canaries.</p>
<p class="par">This international ultimatum was dispatched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>in
conformity to the terms of the Washington Treaty of 1924, which
demanded, irrevocably and without appeal, the extinction of any nation
that employed such barbarous methods of warfare as &aelig;rial warships
and the practice of hurling gun-cotton, dynamite and nitro-glycerine
from the skies upon defenceless cities.</p>
<p class="par">At last Spanish pride was humbled. With a terrible doom
to face, with no friend to counsel, succor or comfort her, Spain was at
last brought to the dregs of humiliation. <span class=
"marginnote">Spain Sheds Crocodile Tears.</span> In vain did that
unhappy country plead for leniency and mercy. Spain was willing to sue
for peace and safety upon any terms, but in vain did that stricken
nation wave the olive branch.</p>
<p class="par">The countenance of the world was withdrawn from Spain.
The Treaty Powers were obdurate and Spain must suffer for the terrible
slaughter of Fez and Tangier. The world in 1930 demanded that an
example should be made. It was determined to settle, once and forever,
the important question of using dynamite and other fulminants as a
weapon of war thrown down from airships. It had been determined that
any nation employing such barbarous methods of warfare should be
uprooted from the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="par">The object and purpose of the thirty-day notice was to
allow the entire population, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>men, women and children, ample time
to leave the doomed kingdom. The Treaty <span class="marginnote">Thirty
Days to Leave Spain.</span> Powers, in seeking to punish Spain, did not
wish to sacrifice life. The punishment Spain was to receive consisted
in the annihilation of her kingdom and the destruction of her cities
and monuments. Like modern Jews, who had lost their Palestine, they
were thereafter to be scattered over the face of the globe, with no
country and no national ensign of their own. Such was the fiat of the
nations in 1930 and this decree was fulfilled to the letter.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the 21st day of May, 1930, a remarkable sight
presented itself over the Pyrenean range of mountains on the northern
boundary of Spain, dividing that country from her northerly neighbor,
&ldquo;la belle France.&rdquo; High above the peaks of <span class=
"marginnote">Arrival of the &ldquo;Death Angels.&rdquo;</span> that
natural barrier between those two countries, and visible to the naked
eye, could be seen what appeared to be a large flock of birds of
enormous size, moving swiftly and silently in a southerly
direction.</p>
<p class="par">Vast multitudes of Spaniards who were crossing the
Pyrenees to seek shelter in French territory, gazed with awe upon the
ominous sight presented by these &ldquo;death angels&rdquo; as they
proceeded south on their errand of destruction. They knew only too well
the character of these deadly messengers of war whose use had been
prohibited in battle by all civilized nations. In the case of Spain
they were not used for purposes of warfare but merely as instruments
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>of punishment for her wanton violation of the
Treaty.</p>
<p class="par">During the preceding thirty days the volume of
immigration from Spain into France had kept an unbroken stream. On the
21st day of May, 1930, the appointed day of doom, a large share of the
Spanish population had found its way across the border into France, and
some of the provinces about Madrid, notably Segovia, Castille and
Salamanca, were as innocent of population as the desert of Sahara is of
cascades.</p>
<p class="par">On that memorable day of May, 1930, the cities of Spain
might easily have been <span class="marginnote">Spanish Cities Two For
a Cent.</span> bought up for a song or a jack lantern. Weyler and his
ferocious cut-throats, (the same imps who blew up our Maine and
martyred 266 brave American sailors), were the only beings who remained
in Spain on that day of doom. The gang had the run of the kingdom for a
few brief hours and were probably amusing themselves very much after
the manner of rats who enjoy the exclusive privilege of a sinking
ship.</p>
<p class="par">The Butcher and his satellites were holding high
carnival in the regal apartments of the Royal Palace in doomed Madrid,
when the &aelig;rial war craft of America, England and the Allied
nations, silently stood guard and floated over the city, veritable
angels of death, fearful to behold. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The cellars of the Royal Palace had been ransacked and
wines of the choicest vintage <span class="marginnote">Handwriting on
the Wall.</span> were being guzzled by the Weyler brigands. Amidst
revelry and shouting, and the din of rattling castenets, the mazes of
fandangos were performed by voluptuous and sinuous Castillian sirens,
from whose wild eyes blazed forth that baleful light, incited by wine
and unholy passion. These dark, olive-skin belles in their terpsichores
before the Butcher and his aides, were as innocent of habiliments as
Madame Eve when that exalted personage made her d&eacute;but in Eden.
In the midst of this debauchery, and while revelry was yet at its
zenith, history again repeated itself. Suddenly, like a prolonged flash
of lightning, the revelers saw distinctly the handwriting on the wall.
It was an inscription that carried terror and consternation into the
hearts of the Weylerites and read: &ldquo;Remember the
Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At this critical and interesting part of the program,
Capt. Sigsbee, (then eighty-one years of age,) who in 1930 commanded
the &aelig;rial warship &ldquo;Maine,&rdquo; and who had been
especially selected for that mission, gave the signal and from her
kelson the &aelig;rial &ldquo;Maine&rdquo; dropped a little surprise
package containing one hundred and thirty pounds of dynamite upon the
Royal Palace of Spain. Weyler and his gang, one moment later, were
roasting in company with their forefathers. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>Such,
then, was the fate of Weyler, the destroyer of our noble
&ldquo;Maine,&rdquo; an <span class="marginnote">More Spanish Mules
Killed.</span> arch fiend whose cruel orders were blindly obeyed by
others of his ilk, carrying to unhappy Cuba a degree of misery,
starvation and death that shocked the entire world.</p>
<p class="par">The British &aelig;rial warships, as well as those of
Germany, Russia, Austria, Italy, France, Holland, Greece and Japan,
took their signal from the first shot or discharge of dynamite dropped
by the &ldquo;Maine,&rdquo; and joined forces with the American
&aelig;rial warships in the total annihilation of Madrid. The scene of
destruction that followed the attack of these &aelig;rial warships
baffles all belief. Indeed, naught may come within the scope of human
imagination that can depict the horrors, wholesale slaughter and utter
desolation that may be wrought by &aelig;rial warships. Ships floating
in the air <span class="marginnote">It&rsquo;s Murder in The
Air.</span> two miles over a city and dropping within its limits huge
charges of dynamite, are fearful engines of destruction. In the twinkle
of an eye they can turn stately churches, lofty buildings, beautiful
homes, hospitals, colleges, parks and pleasure resorts into ashes, and
still vastly more terrible would be the loss of life.</p>

sufficient to make one&rsquo;s flesh creep.</p>
<p class="par">The Washington treaty of 1924, forbidding forever the
use of this barbarous method of warfare and threatening with
destruction any nation that employed it, was a wise and humane
compact.</p>
<p class="par">Spain&rsquo;s flagrant violation of the international
treaty in 1929, when she wantonly destroyed Fez and Tangier, was
universally condemned. On the other hand, the destruction and razing of
Spain in 1930, as a punishment for her bad faith, received the warmest
commendations of the world. It was fully realized that Spain&rsquo;s
chastisement fitted her case as perfectly as the bark fits the tree
that it encircles.</p>
<p class="par">Yet, the razing of Spain in 1930 fills one&rsquo;s
better nature with sadness. The <span class="marginnote">Too Bad about
Spain.</span> widespread destruction of a kingdom replete with historic
memories, rich in treasure-troves of art and science, dotted with
thriving cities, fertile plains, lovely vales and teeming with
beautiful homes, appeals to heart, as well as imagination. Although
richly meriting her fate in 1930, Spain&rsquo;s doom in that year
deeply stirred the hearts of all humanity, but the lesson it taught was
that the world would never tolerate the use in war of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>&aelig;rial dynamite warships, and this lesson
proved a salutary one.</p>
<p class="par">From Cadiz to Saragossa, and from Alicante to Corunna,
the deadly &aelig;rial ships pressed on their way, sweeping destruction
before them. The chief cities of Spain, namely, Barcelona, Valencia,
Seville, Malaga, Murcia, Cartagena, Granada, Cadiz and Saragossa, were
all destroyed in rapid succession, after the fate of Madrid had been
decided. The costly palaces of the Madrid grandees crumbled into dust
from only a few dynamite discharges of these air-ships.</p>
<p class="par">Sad indeed it was to witness the destruction of the
magnificent paintings in the Royal Art Gallery of Madrid, containing as
it did in 1930 three thousand chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres of the
world&rsquo;s immortal artists. The gallery contained the best examples
of Titian, Raphael, Rubens, Muerillo, Van Dyck, Veronese and Tenier, a
grand collection of rare paintings that were valued at $300,000,000,
and that had required several hundreds of years to collect.</p>
<p class="par">Strange to say, in 1930, there was no cathedral in
Madrid for the air-ships to destroy. For some reason, unknown even to
Spaniards, their national capital had never enjoyed this luxury. It is
a maxim, old as the hills, that shoemakers are usually the ones who
wear the shabbiest shoes; the ill-dressed man in a community is very
apt to be the tailor; the most neglected man during <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>sickness
is oftentimes the physician, and the man who invariably neglects to
make his will is the lawyer. Following in the line of this
well-established rule, it ceases to be a surprise that priest-ridden
Spain, the first-born of Rome, should find herself without a cathedral
within the limits of her national capital. If the cathedral of Madrid
escaped the palsied touch of the dynamite air-ships the reason therefor
was simple enough. Madrid never possessed one.</p>
<p class="par">Portugal escaped the ravages of the dynamite air-ships,
and in 1999 that kingdom <span class="marginnote">Ordered West by
Portugal.</span> still proudly guarded the western shores of the
Iberian peninsula. In the spring of the year 1898, Portugal endeared
herself to every American heart when her government ordered Admiral
Cervera and his squadron to sail away from her possessions, the Cape de
Verde islands, and &ldquo;go west.&rdquo; Cervera had to face the
music, and it was with heavy hearts that the mariners on board of the
Oquendo, Marie de Teresa, Vizcaya, Colon, and the torpedo destroyers,
Pluton and Furore, weighed anchor and, like Columbus, set their faces
toward the Western Hemisphere, but, this time, with the certainty that
their noble vessels never again would plough their prows in European
waters.</p>
<p class="par">The inglorious fate of Spain in 1930 ever after proved a
warning to all other nations. In 1999 air-ships navigated the
&ldquo;blue <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>ethereal&rdquo; in every quarter of the globe. It
was a safe, economical and swift method <span class="marginnote">No
More &AElig;rial Warships.</span> of transportation, but after the
destruction of Spain, in 1930, &aelig;rial warships were put out of
commission and condemned. In 1999 so stringent were the international
laws against their use that the mere possession of an &aelig;rial
warship by any nation was likely to embroil others in a war of
extermination and on suspicion alone a most rigid investigation was
instituted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The relations of the United States of the Americas
with Italy in 1999 were of a character that demand more than a passing
notice, going far to illustrate the political eminence that had been
attained in that year by the great American Republic.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1927, the long standing and severe tension
that had existed between the Papacy and the Italian government ever
since Napoleon III in 1870 withdrew his French garrison from the Holy
City, became greatly intensified and had reached an acute stage that
proved beyond human endurance.</p>
<p class="par">The strained relations between the Vatican and the
Quirinal had reached a critical stage. The fierce struggle between
Church and State had attained a point of utmost tension. It became
obvious, even in that year, that the break and parting of the ways
could not be very distant. In 1927 the Popes of Rome had already been
prisoners in the palace of the Vatican for a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>period
of over fifty years. Patience in their case had ceased to be a virtue.
Rome had long been a house divided against itself and its rule under
two kings could not always endure. The delicate position of the Pope
became a most unenviable one. The insolence of the Roman rabble even
found its way under the glorious dome of St. Peter, where, on Palm
Sunday, in the year 1923 Pope Pius X was insulted by a clique from the
Roman slums. That the Holy Pontiff, the spiritual ruler and sovereign
of 328,000,000 Catholics, should experience insult in St.
Peter&rsquo;s, his citadel of strength and power, proved a scandal
beyond belief.</p>
<p class="par">Convinced that his temporal power was forever broken,
Pope Leo XIV in the year <span class="marginnote">The Pope Decides to
Leave.</span> 1945 decided, after consulting a Conclave of Cardinals,
to abandon the city of Romulus and Remus and to shake from his sandals
the dust of ancient Rome. It was at first thought that the College of
Cardinals would check their baggage and take the overland route to
Avignon, in southern France, an honor which many centuries before had
already fallen to the lot of that ancient municipality.</p>
<p class="par">But it was otherwise decreed and great was the
astonishment of the world when its nerves were thoroughly startled by
the startling news that Pope Leo XIV had elected to remove the Papal
See <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>from Rome and to establish it in the United States
of the Americas. The world&rsquo;s astonishment was akin to
consternation when the news of this radical change of base was first
announced and it was learned that the Vatican intended to cast its lot
in the new world.</p>
<p class="par">A proposition to transplant the Papal See from its
ancient anchorage in the Italian <span class="marginnote">It Startles
One&rsquo;s Nerves.</span> peninsula into the new world would have been
scouted in 1899 with scorn and derision as the wild phantasy of a
babbling maniac. People living in 1899 might perhaps have seriously
entertained a proposition to remove the pyramids of Egypt from their
ancient foundations and transfer them to the sandlots of San Francisco,
to open up a Chinese laundry in the King&rsquo;s Chamber; a proposition
to dispatch an army of laborers with shovels to the crater of Vesuvius
and attempt to extinguish that volcano by shoveling in sand, might, in
1899, have been regarded as a plausible undertaking; the attempt of a
delegation of Protestant ministers to personally convert the Sultan of
Turkey from Mohamedanism and induce him to attend a camp-meeting, might
have commended itself to all good citizens in 1899, but the startling
proposition to remove the Papal Court from ancient Rome to South
America, appeared to all minds in 1899 as the most improbable of all
improbabilities, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>yet in 1945, (forty-six years later,) the public
mind was better prepared for this great change and the removal of the
Court of Rome in that year to Rio Janeiro was entertained in better
grace and in a more conciliatory spirit.</p>
<p class="par">In 1945 the position of the Papacy in Rome was no longer
endurable. The <span class="marginnote">Rome Unsafe for the
Pontiff.</span> sacred person of the Pontiff became no longer safe
within the precincts of the Eternal City. The Vatican had been
frequently violated by mobs from the banks of the Tiber and the slums
of Rome, over which the Italian government could effect no control. The
revered head of the church, like his Divine Master while on earth, knew
not where to lay his head.</p>
<p class="par">Europe in 1945 had no refuge or shelter to offer to His
Holiness. Russia, the home of the Greek church, could offer him no
asylum, where one of his exalted rank might dwell in peace. Austria,
that steadfast and ever faithful son of the church, would gladly have
sheltered the Papal Court, assuring it permanent safety and a splendor
commensurate with its prestige, but, unfortunately for Austria in 1945
that country was rent in twain, a shadow of its former greatness.
Hungary had long enjoyed her richly merited independence and in that
year had become a leading European power. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The eyes of the Papacy could not turn to Spain for
succor in 1945. Spain in that year was reduced to a barren waste,
having expiated her crime of 1930, that of employing powerful
fulminants from air-ships to destroy two African cities. France in 1945
had no refuge to offer the Pope<span class="corr" id="xd21e961" title=
"Not in source">.</span> As a result of two unfortunate wars, she had
passed into the custody of Germany, occupying the position of a mere
vassal.</p>
<p class="par">Realizing the serious difficulties which environed the
Papal See in 1945, the Catholic states of the southern tier of the
United States of the Americas, known as South America, made an urgent
appeal that the Court of Rome might be removed into their midst.</p>
<p class="par">Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Venezuela,
Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, <span class="marginnote">The South to the
Rescue.</span> <span class="corr" id="xd21e971" title=
"Source: Paragua">Paraguay</span> and Patagonia levied contributions
among the faithful and between them the munificient sum of $500,000,000
was raised, to be placed at the disposal of the Pope. Accompanying this
gift offering was sent an earnest petition and prayer that the Pope
would consent to abide in the new world, where a splendid reservation
consisting of 17,000 square miles of choice lands had been placed at
his disposal in the neighborhood of Rio Janeiro.</p>
<p class="par">In the petition of the South American States praying His
Holiness to acquiesce in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>this important project, it was
pointed out that the Pope would be domiciled upon the only continent
which was catholic in its entirety, with no creed to oppose, and, in
removing the throne of St. Peter to Rio Janeiro, the Pope would occupy
the position of a patriarch surrounded by his faithful children. The
invisible, but none the less galling fetters, that had enslaved the
Pope since 1870, making him virtually a prisoner in the Vatican, would
be entirely removed. In the State of Brazil he might rule a
principality of no mean proportions, far larger and immeasurably more
wealthy than the Papal kingdom of 1870 when Pius IX was yet King of
Rome. The catholic citizens of South America represented fully the many
advantages of removing the Papal Court from the old into the new
world.</p>
<p class="par">It will be recollected that in 1999 the total population
of the United States of the Americas amounted to 531,000,000. Of this
vast population at least 175,000,000 citizens residing in South America
were adherents of the church of Rome.</p>
<p class="par">The liberal offer that came from the South American
States received the utmost <span class="marginnote">The Pope Accepts
the Offer.</span> attention from the Papal authorities. To withdraw
from that ancient city seemed like the uprooting of all traditions. The
irreligious were prone to make merry over the proposition, predicting
with strange irreverence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>that in Rio Janeiro the Pope would
feel like a cat in a strange garret. But with such innuendoes we have
nothing in common. Let history proceed undisturbed in its course.</p>
<p class="par">It required a heroic sacrifice to give up Rome, filled
with the most precious historic memories, a city in which lies
enshrined the dust of St. Peter&rsquo;s successors. This step meant the
abandonment of that magnificent cathedral, which in 1999 still formed
an aureole of glory about the Eternal City. But Rome in 1945 was no
longer a safe tabernacle for the Papacy. Its mobs were unbridled in
their license. The person of the Pontiff was no longer safe within the
walls of the Vatican. The Italian government proved to be an abettor,
if not an instigator, of these outrages.</p>
<p class="par">With a dark, threatening cloud hovering over the throne
of St. Peter in Europe, and <span class="marginnote">All Headed for the

Sacred College of Cardinals, (the Pope concurring,) gave its official
sanction in 1945 to the removal of the Papal See to the Western

<p class="par first">In 1999 England was the ruler of Africa and her
domain over the Dark Continent was indisputable. From the Delta of the
Nile to Cape Town, from Abyssinia to Liberia, the British lion was free
to roam and roar throughout the enormous, heart-shaped African
continent. From Alexandria to Cape Town became, in 1999, a
comparatively short journey over the electric railroads which in that
year traversed the entire length of the Nile basin, with important
stations at Berber and Khartoum, Uganda, Zambo to Pretoria, thence to
the Terminal of the roads at Cape Town. This electric railroad through
the Nile basin, the lake regions and heart of the African continent,
was completed and in operation in 1930, after a sacrifice in its
construction <span class="marginnote">It Reduced the Census.</span> of
19,000 lives and an outlay of $152,000,000. It proved to be, however,
the backbone of Africa, the vertebral column from which scores of other
electric railroad branches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href=

the ribs of a mastodon.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The great presiding genius and leading spirit in African
railroads was Cecil Rhodes, the same who was regarded as being the most
prominent colonial Englishman. It was through his perseverance and
untiring energy that the great system of African railroads was created
in 1930. Rhodes was a really great man. Thousands courted his favor and
smile, and tens of thousands trembled at his frown. Throughout Southern
Africa so great in 1899 was his power and influence that he was called
the &ldquo;Deputy Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the construction of these African electric railroads
America played an important r&ocirc;le. Cecil Rhodes was at first
inclined to award the contracts for rails, copper wires, cars and
general equipment to English manufacturing firms but his worthy
patriotic sentiments soon vanished when it was demonstrated clear as
sunlight, even early as 1898 that America could produce a far superior
grade of machinery in much less time and at much less cost. In 1901
Cecil Rhodes awarded all his heavy contracts to American firms. In
other words, England furnished the capital and America practically
built the entire system of African railroads in 1930.</p>
<p class="par">The first &ldquo;eye opener&rdquo; in the line of
American competition against British machinery came into prominence in
the spring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>of 1899, when work had already commenced on the
north division of the great trunk line through Africa. The Atbara
bridge and the first lesson in industrial economy that it taught, will
not soon be forgotten. Bids were invited from British and American
<span class="marginnote">America Leads the World.</span> bridge
builders in April, 1899. It was represented to all competitors that the
proposed bridge must be completed in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p class="par">When the bids were opened it was discovered that the
English engineers required seven months to complete the work, while
their American competitors guaranteed to complete and deliver the
bridge in forty-two days from date of signing the contract and the work
was to be completed for a much less sum than the price demanded by the
English builders.</p>
<p class="par">The lesson of the Atbara bridge was not lost upon the
great &ldquo;Deputy Almighty&rdquo; of South Africa and Cecil Rhodes
became the <span class="marginnote">A Peaceful Victory.</span> means
during the first quarter of the twentieth century of securing many
million dollars to the American trade. Africa&rsquo;s most urgent needs
in 1900 were railroads and missionaries. England supplied a very
superior article of the latter, while in the railroad field no country
could equal the American output. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77"
href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the nineteenth century it had been the unpleasant
experience of France to suffer at the hands of England two Waterloos.
<span class="marginnote">France Eats &ldquo;Humble Pie.&rdquo;</span>
One was the great and only Waterloo, which drenched the soil of Belgium
with the blood of many brave men. Waterloo, Jr., overtook the French
soldiers at Fashoda, on Africa&rsquo;s soil in 1899. When in that year
England ordered France to leave Fashoda without any further ceremony a
victory was won by England, bloodless, but none the less effective.</p>
<p class="par">After the Fashoda incident France gradually lost her
African provinces, leaving England in undisputed sway over a continent
that in wealth and resources proved far superior to her great Indian
Empire. In 1999 Alexander II, of Great Britain, ruled over a mighty
empire. In the nineteenth century British kings and queens were just
plain, every day royalties, transacting a legitimate business in that
line and otherwise enjoying the respect and confidence of their
patrons. It was generally understood that the &ldquo;king can do no
wrong.&rdquo; This was indisputable for the simple reason they never
did anything at all. But when great Africa became a British province,
it was then felt necessary to add still another title to the British
Crown and in 1999 Britain&rsquo;s Sovereign became known to his chums
and acquaintances as King of Great Britain and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>Ireland,
D. F., Emperor of India, Mogul of Africa and Right Bower of the
Americas, because, in 1999 none of England&rsquo;s important deals were
regarded as complete without a Yankee plum in the pie. Sometimes
England contrived, as the phrase goes, to &ldquo;get her foot in
it&rdquo; but cousin Jonathan across the salt pond, always managed to
yank her out.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 England still held a firm grip upon India. The
secret of Samson&rsquo;s herculean <span class="marginnote">How England
Holds India.</span> strength was due to the fact that a lawn-mower had
never tampered with his hair. But the secret of the British
lion&rsquo;s power in India did not consist in the fact that the lordly
beast cultivated a full mane.</p>
<p class="par">India in 1999, as in the year 1899, still continued to
remain the world&rsquo;s most brilliant illustration that nations which
are divided among themselves must inevitably fall. In 1899 the question
was repeatedly asked, how can England with a mere corporal&rsquo;s
guard, hold together the vast, mystic India under her sway? How can a
nation of 40,000,000 people, like England, hold under her sway a far
distant continent like India with its population of 350,000,000
people?</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 India still remained a house divided against
itself and England was boss of the whole ranch. The eighty different
principalities of India, each one speaking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>a
different dialect and governed by alien potentates, fired by mutual
hatreds which were fanned by fierce jealousies and the immutable laws
of caste, were still as far apart in 1999, in point of harmony and
cohesive action, as the Himalayan peaks are remote from the spice
groves of Ceylon. <span class="marginnote">Cannot Hold Together.</span>
If at any period in the eighteenth, nineteenth or twentieth centuries
these principalities of India could have united themselves together in
a common cause and arisen in the might of their power against British
rule, England would be driven out of India in ten days&rsquo; time.
India&rsquo;s 350,000,000 population represents an enormous mass, but,
as long as it remains divided into practically eighty different
nations, all of them animated by bitter hatreds and antagonisms,
England will experience no trouble in retaining absolute control of her
large but very acrimonious Indian family.</p>
<p class="par">The power and stamina of the Anglo-Saxon race, which
already dominated the <span class="marginnote">Anglo-Saxons Rule the
World.</span> world in 1999 through the vast Republic of the Americas
and the world-wide British Empire, exemplified itself in a high degree
in the British government of India. Only one desperate struggle was
ever attempted against British rule in India and the disastrous failure
of the mutiny in 1857 was yet fresh in the minds of many in 1999.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=

<p class="par">The great, mighty India, the home of mysteries that
baffle all reason; the fount which holds the sacred Ganges and boasts
of Benares&rsquo; holy soil, was still under the lion&rsquo;s paw in
1999 and bid fair to remain under British rule for many centuries yet
to come. Mystic India, the land of the loftiest mountains, deepest
jungles and broadest plains; the home of Pharsee and Thug; the lair of
lion, tiger, leopard and elephant; the Eden of the deadly cobra, India,
the world&rsquo;s vast and mystic continent, remained a British

Having traveled abroad in the preceding chapter to secure a glimpse of

such unbelievers in the future expansion of America we appeal in vain

other republics joining under one government with ours in 1999.</p>
<p class="par">America in 1899 was yet in the cradle of her infancy,
occupying a modest and narrow strip of territory extending from Maine
to Florida; fringed by Canada on the north and laved by the waters of
the Mexican gulf on the south. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83"

period, at least in commercial affairs, was to gather together the
small concerns and unite them into a whole. <i>The United States of the

Sam was running the biggest concern in the government line and the
little South American Republics had simply been gathered in by the big

by the same constitution, and all lifted up their gaze with patriotic
pride to the Stars and Stripes.</p>
<p class="par">At this juncture it might be interesting to learn by
what means and in what manner was this vast American Republic protected
by sea and land in 1999. Conscious of her vast resources and enormous
strength, America from the close of the Civil War in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>1865 to
the year 1885 remained practically unarmed, keeping on hand a mere
corporal&rsquo;s guard in the shape of an army. Her navy up to 1882
consisted of an aggregation of warships of more or less antiquity, mere
washtubs with smooth bore guns, whose ordnance, discharged against a
modern battleship, would have about the same effect as throwing boiled
peas at a brick wall.</p>
<p class="par">Twenty years after the close of the Civil War, in 1885,
America had commenced to <span class="marginnote">Uncle Sam Wakes
Up.</span> rub her eyes and to awaken from her perilous Rip Van Winkle
siesta of two decades and to realize, at last, that a strong navy had
become a national necessity. Over-confidence is a dangerous foe to
national safety. America, a land filled with liberty-loving patriots
and master mechanics, set to work none too soon to provide herself with
a navy; fighting machines that in point of speed and prowess would
compare favorably with the output of the best foreign shipyards. It
became obvious to the veriest child that if our national dignity at
home or abroad were to be maintained, and, if we did not proposed to be
bluffed by small concerns like Chile and Spain, the best thing to do
about a navy would be to build it at once, forthwith, &ldquo;and on the
word go.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Congress took spirited action in the matter,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>making liberal appropriations for the construction
of a first grade fleet of modern warships, armed and equipped with best
and most penetrating rifles. This patriotic and sensible policy had
been inaugurated none too soon.</p>
<p class="par">The month of January, 1898, found America in possession
of a small, but highly <span class="marginnote">Small but
Powerful.</span> efficient navy and on the brink of war. What we had in
the line of war vessels was of the best, but America could proudly
boast of something immeasurably better than a few fine ships and heavy
guns. We possessed what no Congress or Parliament could make to order
or purchase by appropriation, and that was a keen, patriotic sentiment
throughout both the American army and navy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The man behind the gun,&rdquo; anxious to lay
down his life by the side of the powerful <span class="marginnote">The
True American Hero.</span> breech-loading destroyer he loved so well to
train and groom; &ldquo;the man behind the gun<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1140" title="Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; who loved and cared
for his mighty weapon as a father would his child; watching it by night
and day, praying for the hour when he might belch from its throat
missiles of destruction into the enemy&rsquo;s ranks,&mdash;&ldquo;the
man behind the gun,&rdquo; God bless him, is America&rsquo;s own true
born. In the hour of peril, at Manila, Santiago and at Puerto
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>Rico, these heroes, man and gun, did their duty
right nobly and well. In 1999 the world still rang with the valor of
their deeds.</p>
<p class="par">But America in 1898 found herself still unprepared. The
war issue was lodged with a power of the third magnitude. Left alone
with the Dons the tale would soon be told. Only one year before our war
with the yellow and red flag, an American gentleman summed up the
situation in a very concise manner: &ldquo;When we get at the
Spaniards, they&rsquo;ll hold together just long enough to get kicked
to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But Spain had other partners, two powerful nations, who,
for selfish reasons, would have been only too glad to give Uncle Sam a
punch in the ribs. Germany, having been fortified by a bribe from Spain
for her co-operation against America, having been promised by Spain as
a reward for assistance the entire group of the Philippines, was only
too eager to close the bargain. The Teutons were spoiling for a fight
with Uncle Sam, ostensibly in behalf of Spain, but more especially for
a grab at the Philippines. France, on the other hand, distinctly
recollected that she owned and held the bulk of Spanish securities and
if the Dons in their brush with America took &ldquo;a header,&rdquo;
these Spanish securities would not be worth a last year&rsquo;s bird
nest. And now comes an important question: Was America prepared in 1899
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>to clash in naval combat with the combined forces
of Spain, France and Germany? Josh Billings would have made short shift
of his reply by saying: &ldquo;Well, hardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Spain&rsquo;s two unhappy partners, in their dilemma
then turned their eyes and steps <span class="marginnote">Called at the
Captain&rsquo;s Office.</span> toward a little island that lies
slightly north of their territory. France and Germany heard the growl
of the British Lion and before they joined Spain in a war against
America, John Bull must be consulted. As a result of their interview
this ill-mated pair became well convinced that England would put up
with none of their nonsense and would not remain neutral should they
join Spain in hostilities against America. France and Germany became
converted to other views and very wisely decided to remain at home,
meek as lambs, while Uncle Sam was carving up Spain to suit the
queen&rsquo;s taste.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 our American patriots did not propose to get
caught in the trap of January, 1898, in which America found herself. In
the year first named America was able to meet in war any combination of
European nations that might hazard themselves in the field against her.
The unfortunate spectacle of a great nation like America, on the eve of
war, rushing around as we certainly did in March, 1898, buying up odds
and ends of war vessels and fairly begging to buy smokeless powder at
any price, will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>never again be repeated in this great country. The
lesson of 1898 was yet fresh in the minds of all in 1999. Americans of
the twentieth century were too shrewd to get caught napping again in
that manner.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 the United States of the Americas embraced
eighty-five states. Canada <span class="marginnote">The New American
Navy.</span> had been divided into two American States, namely, East
and West Canada. The original territory of the United States in that
year consisted of sixty-two sovereign states; Texas alone had been
divided into three separate states. To these were added the six states
of Central America, namely, the newly created American States of
Mexico, Nicaragua, Salvador, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1165" title=
"Source: Costo">Costa</span> Rica, Guatemala and Honduras. Next came
the newly admitted American States of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador,
Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Chile, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1168" title=
"Source: Argentine">Argentina</span>, Uruguay, Paraguay and Patagonia,
making a grand total of eighty-five states, which formed in 1999 the
United States of the Americas.</p>
<p class="par">By enactment of Congress provision had been made that
every State in the Union must build, equip and maintain at its own cost
at least one battleship of the most modern type and unrivalled power;
one armored cruiser of the highest speed, (35 knots per hour,) and
three submarine destroyers of the most approved pattern and of the most
enterprising character. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As a result of this wise policy the navy of the Americas
in 1999 consisted of eighty-five (85) first grade battleships; one
hundred and seventy (170) of the swiftest and most powerful cruisers;
two hundred and <span class="marginnote">Five hundred and Ten
Warships.</span> fifty-five (255) submarine destroyers, popularly
called in that year, &ldquo;uplifters.&rdquo; Such was the numerical
strength of the American Navy during the closing period of the
twentieth century, on a peace footing. In the remote possibility of a
war, provision had been made to mobilize the American fleet upon a far
more formidable standard of efficiency. The total number of our war
craft of all classes aggregated in that year, five hundred and ten
(510) vessels.</p>
<p class="par">When one reflects that the coast-line of the great
Republic, along the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the Americas,
embraces fully 34,000 miles, every mile of which was entitled to our
national defence, it will be recognized that the American Navy in 1999
was barely in keeping with the vast proportions of the Republic it had
been created to defend. Indeed, it was regarded as being a modest
establishment of its kind, judged by the standards of that period.</p>
<p class="par">The question very properly offers itself, &ldquo;If the
United States of the Americas in 1999 represented such a powerful
nation, wealthy and prosperous, potent in enterprise and industry, what
use had it for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>navy of five hundred and ten warships?&rdquo; This
question is easily answered by quoting an old and sterling axiom:
&ldquo;In time of peace we must prepare for war.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The folly of March 1898, when America, on the eve of war
with Spain, rushed in <span class="marginnote">Not to be Caught
Again.</span> breathless haste into every European navy-yard to
purchase any thing that could float a gun, and offered haystacks of
gold for smokeless powder, was not to be repeated in 1999. It was
recognized in that year that the best guarantee for peace was to
maintain an efficient army and powerful navy, to exact a proper respect
for a flag that protected 531,000,000 American citizens.</p>
<p class="par">The big American Republic in 1999 did not propose to
place itself, with its vast population and interminable coast-line, in
the humiliating condition of China, a people who, though mighty in
population, remain helpless as infants in matters of national defence.
America did not intend to suffer the fate of China. Although her
territory was vast and her population reckoned by the half-billion,
America did not propose to permit European cormorants to pounce upon
her coasts, and, as in the case of China, steal a whole country under
the guise of civilizing it. In 1999 the Americas maintained a
formidable army and navy in order to impress the fact upon the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>world that we were not like lambs, wholly without
means of self-defense.</p>
<p class="par">The perilous American policy, inaugurated after the
Civil War, of existing without any army or navy worthy of the name, was
exposed through our war with Spain. Americans cheerfully acknowledged
the fact that England&rsquo;s friendliness tended to bring that war to
an early close. Even Spain in 1898 professed to hold our army in
exalted contempt, regarding Americans as a nation wholly unfit for war,
at best, a nation of wheat raisers and pork-packers. Many Spaniards
honestly imagined that Admiral Cervera could sail his squadron into New
York harbor, land his marines at Coney Island and after bombarding the
clams and battling with lager kegs, march his men over the Brooklyn
Bridge and capture City Hall.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 Americans did not propose to again get caught
napping, as in the &ldquo;good old <span class="marginnote">Eternal
Vigilance in 1999.</span> days&rdquo; of 1898. They remained armed and
ready for war on drop of the hat. No nation in the former year would
venture unaided to combat the great American Republic. America in the
twentieth century became invincible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">Justice done to both Schley and Sampson. The
American victory off Santiago opens the eyes of the world. Emperor
Wilhelm congratulates himself. America maintains a vigorous Monroe
Doctrine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long before the advent of 1910 every trace of the
bitter controversy that had so long disturbed American naval circles
over the Sampson-Schley quarrel, had fortunately been effaced. The
hatchet had been buried, or figuratively speaking, had been thrown
overboard, and in 1999 this unhappy feud, which tarnished the prestige
of the world&rsquo;s foremost navy, had been obliterated. In 1999, when
all heat or vestige of passion had passed away, this unfortunate
episode was regarded as being the one and only blot that associated
itself with the memory of a wonderful naval exploit, the brilliant
engagement on that ever memorable Sunday morning of July 3, 1898, when
the Spanish squadron steamed into the jaws of death.</p>
<p class="par">Time accomplishes wonders. It tones <span class=
"marginnote">The Brave American Officers.</span> down the angles; it
dulls the keenest edge and can even render mild, bitter animosities,
which, alas, often sting sharper than serpent fangs. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>Long
before 1900 it was universally acknowledged that gallant Admiral Schley
had been persecuted. His tormentors, men of high station, became
heartily ashamed of persecuting a brave officer who had committed what
apparently, in their judgment, appeared to be the crime of annihilating
the Spanish squadron off Santiago.</p>
<p class="par">Students of history in 1910 very naturally asked
themselves: &ldquo;If Admiral Schley was so bitterly assailed at the
close of a sweeping victory, in what manner would he have been treated
by these carping critics had a portion of Cervera&rsquo;s fleet made
good its escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Admiral Sampson appeared to be willing <span class=
"marginnote">Sampson&rsquo;s Unlucky Absence.</span> and anxious to
secure credit for a victory that had been fought and won during his
absence. But the question arises, would Admiral Sampson have been
willing to shoulder the blame if Cervera&rsquo;s vessels had escaped
destruction or would he have saddled Admiral Schley with the
responsibility? The reader must form his own conclusions in this
matter. On the other hand, all impartial students of history in the
twentieth century cheerfully accorded to Admiral Sampson full credit
for his gallant services on blockade duty during that war. His
responsibilities were great and pressing, and he discharged his duties
with utmost fidelity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94"
name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A pathetic story indeed is that of the <span class=
"marginnote">The Ever Watchful Eye.</span> &ldquo;Man in the Iron
Mask.&rdquo; None can read that page of French history without being
touched by the sad fate of this mysterious prisoner of state, who was
generally supposed to be a twin brother of the King of France. He was
treated by his attendants with the utmost deference and courtesy. His
raiments were of the costliest fabrics. The governor of the citadel in
which the &ldquo;Man in the Iron Mask&rdquo; was imprisoned, was
obsequious in his attentions to the distinguished prisoner. His wishes
were observed with the most scrupulous care and the Great Unknown ever
ruled his guardians with the sceptre of a king. The prisoner, however,
was obliged to wear his iron mask night and day. Any attempt on his
part to remove it, meant swift and certain death.</p>
<p class="par">The feature of his confinement which, perhaps, directly
appeals to the world&rsquo;s sympathy, was the human eye that watched
his every movement. Through a hole in the door of his apartment, (which
was sumptuously furnished,) that eye never relaxed its vigilance. Night
and day its ceaseless vigil continued until death&rsquo;s kindly hand
relieved the distinguished sufferer from the terror of its unceasing
gaze.</p>
<p class="par">And so it was with Cervera and his squadron. The Spanish
admiral became the modern &ldquo;Man in the Iron Mask.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>A prisoner behind the lofty hills of Santiago,
<span class="marginnote">Watched by Night and Day.</span> the eyes of
Sampson&rsquo;s fleet watched the narrow opening of that harbor night
and day, nor did their vigilance relax for one second of time. By night
the piercing eye of the electric search-light closely watched the
harbor entrance. The thoughts, the hopes and prayers of our noble
America were all centered upon Sampson and his brave men. He proved
himself to be an excellent fleet commander and in the twentieth century
his services were appreciated at their just value.</p>
<p class="par">The glorious victory at Santiago bay, occurring only
sixty days after Dewey&rsquo;s target practice in Manila bay, amazed
and electrified the world. England felt a genuine <span class=
"marginnote">American Plymouth Rocks.</span> pride in both of these
achievements and pointing to America observed: &ldquo;These American
roosters are from our own setting and their name is Plymouth
Rock.&rdquo; When the German Emperor heard the great news from Santiago
very few men in Europe were more pleased over it. His joy, however, was
prompted by feelings of self-preservation rather than from exultation
over the American victory. Wilhelm patted himself on the back and shook
hands with himself for at least five consecutive hours when he
reflected how narrowly he had escaped getting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>involved
in a war with America and the fortunate escape of his German fleet from
the fate that overtook Cervera&rsquo;s vessels. This is the reason why
the German squadron cleared out of Manila immediately after Dewey sent
his famous request to Washington to <span class="corr" id="xd21e1250"
title="Source: despatch">dispatch</span> the Oregon to Manila,
&ldquo;for political reasons.&rdquo; The &ldquo;bulldog of the American
navy&rdquo; reached Manila in due season but Admiral Von Deiderichs
withdrew long before the &ldquo;crack of doom&rdquo; had ploughed her
way into that harbor. As for France in 1910 she had not yet recovered
from her surprise, while to Spain these disasters proved a paralytic
shock of a most severe character. From 1898 to 1930 Spain was merely
walking around to stave off funeral expenses.</p>
<p class="par">With a relatively strong navy of five hundred and ten
(510) war ships to patrol her coasts in 1999, the United States of the
<span class="marginnote">Large Army not Wanted.</span> Americas were
not under any necessity of maintaining a large standing army. It was
fully realized that an efficient sea-power must be maintained. With
that arm of defence in her possession the maintenance of a large
standing American army can never seriously be entertained. It has
always been a popular belief in America that if a foreign army of
invasion were to land upon our shores, Americans would give it a very
warm reception, so spontaneous and effusive in its character
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>that a majority of the invaders would never find
their way back home again. Many of them might become permanent
residents in American soil, so deeply rooted that none but
Gabriel&rsquo;s trump could marshal them into line again.</p>
<p class="par">Germany in 1899 held the world&rsquo;s medal
<span class="marginnote">Germany&rsquo;s Splendid Army.</span> for the
finest and best equipped army, a magnificent engine of war, ready to
move within an hour&rsquo;s notice, and woe to the enemy that obstructs
its path. Without any doubt in the closing period of the nineteenth
century the General staff of the German army was justly regarded as the
highest authority in military science. Such a vast and smooth working
engine for the destruction of human beings was never before known. If
the sun had been good enough to stop twelve hours in its course to
accommodate Joshua&rsquo;s beggarly army, that luminary would no doubt
gladly stand still a whole week on request of the chief of staff of the
German hosts.</p>
<p class="par">In 1899, with a population of barely 50,000,000, Germany
possessed an army of 2,500,000. France with much less population had
fully as many men under arms. Russia with a population of over
90,000,000 had an army on a peace footing of 3,000,000 men. The burden
upon Europe was a most crushing one. In 1899 this drain was fast
sapping the life of those nations, robbing their industries and
peaceful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>avocations of the flower of their youth. This
armed state in the time of peace was fully as ruinous as war itself. No
wonder that the Czar of Russia urged a congress of the nations to
convene and, if possible, devise some system to reduce these huge
armaments. For this well-meaning attempt to relieve the military
burdens of Europe the Russian Czar deserves much credit but,
unfortunately, the proposition proved to be impracticable. The
international conference at the Hague in the summer of 1899 secured no
definite results.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 America did not propose to fall <span class=
"marginnote">No Standing Army in 1999.</span> into the European snare
of maintaining a huge standing army. When America in 1899 was merely a
small Republic, consisting of only forty-five states and a few odd
territories, the idea of maintaining a large standing army, on the
European plan, was scouted with derision. In 1899 Americans scoffed at
Europe&rsquo;s military establishments as a symbol of Barbarism. In
1999 when the great American Republic included the entire Western
Hemisphere, military rule became more unpopular than ever. In the
twentieth, as in the nineteenth century, America remained firm in her
adherence to the Monroe Doctrine. This wise policy will always prove
one of the best safeguards of our American Republic. Europe must be
kept out of the Western Hemisphere. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99"
href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>America will always belong to
Americans only. In the twentieth century the Monroe Doctrine lost none
of its force, and for many centuries its principles will still remain a
living issue.</p>
<p class="par">With a Monroe Doctrine to maintain and defend, it is not
surprising to learn that in 1999 the United States of the Americas,
with a population of 531,000,000, maintained a small army of 150,000
men. The absolute freedom of America from military burdens in 1899 and
1999 was the glory of the Republic and the envy of a whole world.</p>
<p class="par">The object of government is to guarantee the utmost
allowance of freedom to the citizen, and blessed indeed is the nation
that can govern itself without having to maintain a huge standing army
to hurl at any moment&rsquo;s notice at its neighbors<span class="corr"
id="xd21e1281" title="Not in source">.</span> Such barbarism may answer
well enough for Europe, whose governments are founded upon wrong
principles, but in great, free America, we want none of it, nor never
shall.</p>
<p class="par">America always will be the land of the free. Her
principles of government are founded upon justice and equity. The voice
of the people is heard in the land and it is supreme. The government of
the people, by and for the people, is the gift of God to Man and the
Almighty has made America the custodian of that priceless jewel.

<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">When the Stars and Stripes floated over the Entire
Hemisphere in 1990 Washington, the National Capital, was removed to
Mexico. The name of the new capital unchanged. Vera Cruz becomes the
Seaport of Washington. The Canal completed in 1915. The new location

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the good Lord created the earth He reserved
the Western Hemisphere for the exclusive use and control of the
Yankees. They were not slow to avail themselves of their opportunity.
This comes from force of habit; opportunities they allow to pass by
unimproved are as scarce as Swiss Admirals. Americans are warranted to
take care of themselves under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="par">It will surprise no one to learn that in 1999 the
Western Hemisphere had passed in its entirety under the dominion of the
Stars and Stripes. Americans did not pounce upon and seize the
continent, nor did they even fire one shot to secure its entire
control. Canada, Central and South America simply gravitated towards
the American Union and became absorbed into one great Republic.</p>
<p class="par">The smaller Republics of the Americas realized that the
United States in 1899 were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>a peace-loving nation. Although
its army was a mere corporal&rsquo;s guard, America had a population in
that year aggregating 75,000,000. Such a large nation with an
insignificant army could mean them no harm. One by one they joined our
American Union of their own free will and volition, until in 1999 the
great American Union became an accomplished fact.</p>
<p class="par">To attempt to rule such a vast stretch of country under
any other than the great <span class="marginnote">It could Govern the
World.</span> Constitution of the United States, would result in a
signal failure. The American Constitution, that masterpiece and perfect
symbol of human liberty, is great enough and broad enough to govern the
entire globe under one flag. Indeed as early as 1999 there were already
strong indications that before the expiration of three more centuries
such might be the eventual result. It already looked in that year as
though the great American Republic would ultimately gather under its
wings, Europe, Asia, Africa and the islands of Oceanica.</p>
<p class="par">However, there is a limit to human ambition; there is a
boundary to all possibilities. Comparatively speaking, we are dealing
<span class="marginnote">America does not want the Earth.</span> only
with a near future when we behold, in 1999, the proud flag of America,
that emblem of liberty which never suffered defeat, floating over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>one vast Republic from Alaska to Patagonia.
Other dreamers may hustle for notoriety by claiming in an aimless way
that in 2999 the American flag will float over all the continents of
the world. They may even wish to annex a few of the planets under the
American flag, but heed them not.</p>
<p class="par">Daniel Webster&rsquo;s eloquent words: &ldquo;The Union,
now and forever, one and inseparable,&rdquo; reached a climax when the
United States of the Americas consolidated in 1999. Nor was there a
discordant note in the grand concert of eighty-five states. Mason and
Dixon&rsquo;s line became a memory of the past. The northern states
from Alaska and Canada to Florida; the middle states from Mexico to
Costa Rica and the southern states from Colombia to Patagonia, were all
linked together in the bonds of friendship and brotherly love. At last
Webster&rsquo;s prophecy had been fulfilled; the great Union had become
&ldquo;one and inseparable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">To the inquiring mind the question naturally offers
itself: In what manner was the great American Republic governed in
1999? Were the commands of the Federal government still issued from
Washington, D. C., or had it been found more convenient to transfer the
seat of government to a locality better adapted and more central to the
new conditions of the greater Republic?</p>

<p class="par">In 1990, by decree of Congress of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>United Americas, and at the close of a
<span class="marginnote">Capital transferred to Mexico.</span> special
national election held for that purpose, both houses of Congress by a
two-thirds vote, elected to transfer the seat of our National
government from Washington, D. C., to the city of Mexico, which in
1999, commanded a position midway between the North and South sections
of the great Republic. Although transferred by act of Congress to the
city of Mexico, our National Capital in 1999 still retained the
glorious name of Washington. The name of Washington, D. C., was changed
to that of Columbia.</p>
<p class="par">Statesmen in 1990 wisely decided to retain the name of
Washington for the National Capital of the great Republic. A few were
in favor of retaining the ancient name of Mexico for the new capital
but the vast majority of our American voters in 1990 treasured with
patriotic love and tenderness the revered name of the Father of his
Country. They believed that no matter where the capital of the Republic
might be moved to, whether it were located in Brazil or in Alaska, the
fame of Washington must go with it and bear the honored association of
that name.</p>
<p class="par">Washington, D. C., took the new name of Columbia, having
become a city of secondary political importance. The name of Washington
belongs to the national capital <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104"
href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>alone, the home of Congress,
the residence of the National Executive and forum of the Supreme Court
of the Americas. The hero of Valley Forge and champion of American
Independence was still near and dear to every heart in 1990, and may
centuries yet unborn honor his memory.</p>
<p class="par">The city of Mexico became the Capital of the Americas
for manifold reasons, <span class="marginnote">Mexico a Natural
Centre.</span> chiefly political, strategical and commercial. To those,
who, in 1899 had been accustomed from birth to regard the United States
as that narrow strip of country lying between Canada and the Gulf of
Mexico, the announcement that the capital of the Americas had been
transferred to the city of Mexico, must cause a shock of unpleasant
sensation.</p>
<p class="par">It is a human weakness to worship our idols. Woe to
those who would destroy them. Tradition must not be tampered with.
Americans of 1899 had been taught that a small and beautiful city on
the Potomac was the capital of our Federal Union. To them it must come
in the nature of a shock to learn that in 1990 the name of that city
had changed to Columbia, and Washington, the National Capital, had been
transferred to the State of Mexico.</p>
<p class="par">There are, however, other instances on record in which
it has been deemed advisable to change the capital of a great nation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>If in the year 1810 an intelligent Russian had
announced to his countrymen that the seat of government in Russia would
be transferred in 1812 from golden, sacred Moscow to bleak, cold St.
Petersburg on the barren swamps of the Neva, his prediction would have
been laughed to scorn; such a statement would have encountered a
tempest of derision. Your orthodox Russian would have raved at the mere
mention of such an eventuality. In 1810 any intelligent Russian would
have regarded the abandonment of ancient Moscow, the custodian of the
Kremlin, for a barren spot on the shores of the Baltic, as a positive
sacrilege. Yet it is historically true that in 1812 this very thing
came to pass.</p>
<p class="par">Instead of uprooting our National Capital from a spot
hallowed with sacred traditions <span class="marginnote">In Perpetual
Sunshine and Flowers.</span> and transplanting it into a cold, sterile
region, as in the case of the Russian capital, Washington, as a seat of
government, was removed from the banks of the Potomac into the
splendors of a tropical region,&mdash;into the domain of Montezuma and
his brave Aztec warriors, where fruits and flowers chase one another in
an unbroken circle through the year; a paradise where the gales are
loaded with perfumes of the forests in which birds of radiant plumage
and exquisite song fill the air with their delicious melodies.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Washington in 1999 was fast developing into a
magnificent city, worthy of its proud <span class="marginnote">An
Earthly Paradise.</span> name and eminence as the capital of the great
American Republic with its population of 531,000,000 people. Built in
the heart of the State of Mexico, it was surrounded by magical charms
of scenery such as only a tropical paradise may develop. Its lofty
domes and spires and stately public buildings, many of them constructed
of huge blocks of multi-colored glass, were reared amidst a land
luxuriant with the cochineal, cocoa, the orange and sugar-cane.</p>
<p class="par">The city of Washington in 1999 was hedged by
nature&rsquo;s most subtle art. Beyond the capital&rsquo;s limits were
visible a gay confusion of meadows, streams and perpetual flowering
forests. From the centre of the new Washington could plainly be seen
the majestic outlines of ancient Popocatapetl, rising as a sombre
spectre whose rugged head seemed to cleave the skies.</p>
<p class="par">Stretching far away to the right, and clearly visible
from the observatory of the Executive Mansion might be seen, towering
in its solitary grandeur, the peak of the mighty Orizaba, with its
eternal shroud of snow descending far down its sides. How many
centuries this mighty giant of the Cordilleras has stood there, a
sentinel in the Garden of the Gods, none may tell. But <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>ages
and cycles of time after the busy brains of 1899 shall have turned to
dust, Orizaba, with the Stars and Stripes adorning its summit, will
still rear its proud head and gaze down upon millions of American
patriots yet unborn.</p>
<p class="par">The transferment of the capital of the Americas in 1990
to the city of Mexico, <span class="marginnote">Met with General
Approval.</span> was generally regarded as a master-stroke of policy.
From a hygienic point of view alone, the change proved eminently a
desirable one. Its removal from the malodorous swamps of the Potomac to
the elevated plateau upon which the Aztec race reared their ancient
capital, with its balmy breezes and tropical luxuriance, proved a most
welcome change. It was generally conceded in 1899 that the site of
Washington on the malaria-breeding banks of the Potomac, was not a
happy selection.</p>
<p class="par">In spite of great precautions several epidemics had
devastated the national capital during the decades from 1900 to 1940.
Among other pestilential attractions of the Potomac swamps, great
prominence was given to a fierce and aggressive tribe of mosquitoes,
called &ldquo;Swamp Angels,&rdquo; which in 1920 increased and
multiplied greatly, to the absolute terror of the Washingtonites. It is
related of these aggressive and dangerous pests that in 1925 a swarm of
them actually carried away a sheep while the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>animal was grazing upon the White House
downs.</p>
<p class="par">But aside from its favorable hygienic considerations the
central position of the city of Washington in the State of Mexico
commanding the main avenue between North and South America, gave it
great political and commercial importance as the capital of the
Americas in 1990, one that was enjoyed by no other rival.</p>
<p class="par">The capture and destruction of Washington, in the State
of Mexico, could not have <span class="marginnote">It Became
Impregnable.</span> been effected in 1999 or at any subsequent period.
The city in that year became impregnable, so rendered by a vast system
or chain of fortresses from the city proper to Vera Cruz, its seaport,
a distance of about two hundred miles. The mountain passes and rugged
defiles between Washington and Vera Cruz frowned with heavy ordnance.
Dynamite guns were ready on every hand to scatter their deadly
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1389" title=
"Source: missles">missiles</span> for the edification of all invaders.
From Washington to Vera Cruz, great sentinel forts stood in the path of
the invader, an unassailable chain, many of them being hardly visible
to the eye. Fortifications were constructed upon the high table lands
of the Cordilleras, also upon the apex of precipices, and from these
dizzy summits shrinking eyes might gaze down two and three thousand
feet and admire the bewildering beauties of tropical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>vegetation. It was estimated by leading
engineers in 1999 that with its line of defences to the coast the
capital of the United States of the Americas was impervious to the
assaults of the world.</p>
<p class="par">The port of Vera Cruz, only two hundred miles east of
Washington in a direct line, had been permitted to retain its original
name when Mexico became a part and parcel <span class=
"marginnote">Washington&rsquo;s Outlet to the Sea.</span> of the
American Union. This concession was made in honor of Cortes, the
conqueror of Mexico, the boldest and most intrepid of all warriors of
the middle ages, who founded the city of Vera Cruz and destroyed his
fleet of vessels so as to compel his followers to wrest from the sway
of Montezuma, the city of Mexico. It was at Vera Cruz that Cortes
founded the first Spanish colony on the American mainland. In honor and
memory of the valiant Spanish commander and his daring exploits in
1520, it was deemed a point of courtesy to retain for that city the
baptismal name Cortes had endowed upon it.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 its spacious harbor was taxed to its utmost
capacity to accommodate the world&rsquo;s commerce while en route
through the Nicaraguan Canal, which was opened to navigation in 1915,
having cost its American investors $195,000,000. The proximity of Vera
Cruz to the canal rendered that city an available port, bringing to it
a wonderful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>volume of trade and commerce, and as Vera Cruz
in 1999 was merely the ocean outlet of Washington, it will be readily
appreciated that the opening of the Nicaraguan Canal and the volume of
traffic it diverted in that direction, added materially to the
importance of that region as the seat in 1999 of our national
government. The completion of the Nicaragua Canal in 1915 was a triumph
to the American science of engineering, yet so tardy in conception and
execution that it reflected at best only an uncertain honor. It should
have been constructed and opened to navigation as early <span class=
"marginnote">Importance of the Canal.</span> as 1885. It was a case of
sheer neglect on the part of America. As soon as the Panama bubble
exploded and Frenchmen discovered that they had been hoodwinked by
speculators, America should have lost no time in constructing the
Nicaragua Canal.</p>
<p class="par">The lesson of the Spanish War has taught America the
value of an ocean canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
With the possession of the Philippines and an enormous Oriental trade
the operation of this canal became a factor of the highest importance
to America.</p>
<p class="par">An American fleet of warships in the spacious bay of
Vera Cruz, only two hundred miles away from Washington, was enabled in
1999 to steam through the canal into the Pacific in only a few
hours&rsquo; time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>and proceed to Hawaii and the Orient in
short order. This was a great improvement on the &ldquo;good old
days&rdquo; of 1899 when war vessels and transports, leaving New York
to go to Manila, had to crawl around the tempestuous Horn or travel
via. Suez.</p>
<p class="par">The construction of the interoceanic canal added greatly
to the importance of the new location for our National capital in the
State of Mexico. Vera Cruz became the rendezvous of the world&rsquo;s
commerce. The central location of Washington in the State of Mexico,
midway between the two great continents, proved an advantageous and
commanding one and was eminently satisfactory to all sections of the
great American Republic in 1999.</p>
<p class="par">In considering the vast importance of ocean canal
navigation to the Americas, it is well to ascertain what became of the
Philippine Islands and China in 1999.</p>
<p class="par">In that year of our Lord, the world was practically
governed by three great powers. <span class="marginnote">Three Great
Powers in 1999.</span> The first and greatest of the trio was the vast
American Republic, which in that memorable year extended from Alaska to
Patagonia. Next came Great Britain, whose sway was undisputed over the
vast continents of India, Africa and Australia, along with valuable
islands of the seas, like the articles of a traditional auction bill,
&ldquo;are too numerous to mention.&rdquo; The third great Power in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>1999 was Russia. The ruler of all the Russias
was not only Czar of the European and Siberian domains, but he was also
crowned at the sacred Kremlin as the Emperor of China. A glance at the
map of the world will show that in 1999 Russia was in possession of
nearly one-fourth of the globe&rsquo;s real estate. Not satisfied with
this, Russian ambition had designs upon India, intending to employ
China as her base of operations. England, however, was always alert and
ready to frustrate her designs.</p>
<p class="par">When the nations of Europe in 1898 were carving up
China, (even Spain and Italy joining in the scramble for pieces of
China-ware,) Russia, her nearest neighbor on the north, was careful to
secure the biggest share of the booty. In 1895 Russia saved China from
the clutches of Japan, for the philanthropic purpose of doing the
stealing act herself. After appropriating China&rsquo;s best provinces
on the north, and profiting by the completion of the Trans-Siberian
railroad in the year 1905, Russian influence at the court of Pekin,
overshadowed all others. The Chinese, like all other Orientals, believe
only what they see. Russia had long been their only neighbor in Siberia
but when the great Russian railroad was completed to Port Arthur, in a
very short period an army of 450,000 well drilled Russian soldiers was
bivouacked near the great wall of China, within rifle shot of Pekin.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Once firmly seated on China&rsquo;s neck, Russian
<span class="marginnote">The Russian Emperor of China.</span> diplomacy
moulded the Middle Kingdom as clay in the potter&rsquo;s hand. Its
enormous population obeyed implicitly the Czar&rsquo;s ukases, and in
1999 China became a Russian province as completely as the Crimea.</p>
<p class="par">Russia, however, had always entertained a warm
friendship and cordial regard for the United States of America ever
since the rebellion of 1860&ndash;65 and her good wishes were
reciprocated on the part of all Americans. Russian respect for America
became firmer and more binding as the young American Republic attained
its enormous dimensions. Russia, great herself, realized that she had a
right to be regarded in the same class as our noble country. As an
evidence of Russian esteem for America, during the period from 1920 to
1999, Russia granted to Americans special trade privileges in China in
which other nations were not permitted to share.</p>
<p class="par">As a result of these generous concessions to Americans
our trade with China in 1999 attained gigantic proportions and
nine-tenths of it passed through the Nicaragua canal. So important did
our Oriental trade become in the twentieth century that the
inter-oceanic canal would have been built even though it had been
necessary to pave its channel with bricks of gold and silver. American
wheat had largely supplanted rice <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>as the staple food of China,
and in 1999 the American export of wheat to China was estimated at a
value of $95,000,000. America monopolized nearly the entire Chinese
trade in farming implements, electrical machines, cotton goods, dyes
and chemicals.</p>
<p class="par">As to the Philippines, the trade with that <span class=
"marginnote">Peace and Prosperity Restored.</span> archipelago was
entirely controlled by America. After the proud flag of America had
floated one century over those islands, the transformation scene was
wonderful. The Filipinos had long learned, after the fall of Aguinaldo,
that the American Constitution was broad and big enough to amply
protect and to give them that measure of liberty to which all nations
are entitled. Long before 1920 they became a docile, patient and
laborious people and prospered in an amazing degree. Their exports of
hemp, rice and tobacco attained immense proportions and the culture of
sugar-cane became so profitable that the Philippines were famed in 1999
as the &ldquo;Sugar Bowl of the Pacific.&rdquo; America proved a
Godsend to those islands. The names of Dewey, Otis and Lawton were held
in high esteem for many centuries after Dewey&rsquo;s great victory,
which awakened America, electrified the world and gave birth to the
grandest Republic the world had ever seen. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Dreamer, thus far, has invited the attention
of the reader to the political conditions extant in 1999. In the
preceding chapters we have contemplated with feelings exultant,
national pride, the superb growth of the United States of the Americas,
from a comparatively narrow strip of territory in 1899 to a magnificent
Republic in 1999, consisting of eighty-five sovereign States, extending
from Alaska to Patagonia, and embracing in one Republic the continents
of North, Central and South America. In order to arrive at a lucid
comprehension of the political status of the great American Republic
and its relationship towards the world in 1899, we have reviewed the
conditions of other nations of that period. We must now pass on to the
consideration of other social and economic conditions which were
prevalent in the American Republic during the twentieth century.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Do not imagine for one moment that in the brief compass
of a century human nature <span class="marginnote">Human Nature Remains
The Same.</span> had changed in any perceptible or appreciable degree.
In the year 1899 the traits of humanity were identical with those which
were known to the world in the days of the C&aelig;sars. The ebb and
flow of human passions, love and hatred in the days of the Pharaohs
differed in nowise from those of 1899. If forty centuries did not
change our human tendencies, it will not surprise the reader to learn
that in 1999 the human family was much the same in its tastes and
inclinations as in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="par">The eighteenth century was an era of oak and sails; the
nineteenth century proved to be an age of iron, steel and steam, but
the twentieth century witnessed far greater strides of improvement
resulting from the solution of the &aelig;rial navigation problem and
the conquest of electricity. The solution of these two great problems
alone rendered the twentieth century the most marvelous age of all
since the birth of Christ.</p>
<p class="par">Ever since humanity has trodden upon this green,
fruitful world of ours; ever since the gaze of man has turned upward
and penetrated the skies, from the days of Adam and perhaps ages before
that first settler made his appearance on earth, the problem of
&aelig;rial navigation has agitated human <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>breast and brain. To
solve this difficult secret has long been the acme of human ambition.
In 1899 we knew very little more about &aelig;rial navigation than did
Noah and his family in the days when Mt. Arrarat was first used as a
dry-dock.</p>
<p class="par">Quite certain it is that &aelig;rial navigation ten
thousand years hence will be limited to <span class="marginnote">A
Limited Field After all.</span> a moderate elevation from the earth.
Never as long as the world endures will human beings with breath in
their nostrils and blood in their veins reach or travel at an altitude
of over six miles above the earth&rsquo;s surface. We know this because
death would overtake every venturesome traveler who soared into those
higher regions. A thousand years hence the laws of nature will still
remain immutably the same.</p>
<p class="par">But the ambition of mankind is to control the air at a
reasonable distance from the earth&rsquo;s surface and to navigate an
element that is entirely free from all obstructions. The aim is to so
control an &aelig;rial machine that it will not drift before every
wind, but cleave the air and move along its course in defiance of the
storm. To this must be added a guarantee of safety that the public is
certain to exact before embarking upon an &aelig;rial voyage.
&AElig;rial navigation, no doubt, offers vast attractions but while
sailing through the air, with the ease and grace of a bird, it might
prove very inconvenient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>for passengers to fall out at a
height of a mile or two and land through the roof of some peaceful,
happy home or find themselves while unceremoniously falling securely
hooked in the fork of a tree. Such little mishaps in &aelig;rial
navigation had to be guarded against.</p>
<p class="par">&AElig;rial navigation was perfected about the
<span class="marginnote">The First Airships.</span> year 1925. After
repeated failures of the Langley system from 1896 to 1920, the learned
Washington professor changed his plans. Instead of endeavoring to lift
flat-irons with wings from the ground, and watching turkey buzzards at
anchor in the air over the Potomac river, Langley finally created an
&aelig;rial machine that was operated by electricity and moved by a
large, swiftly revolving propeller, somewhat resembling those employed
in steam navigation, but with blades at a more abrupt angle.</p>
<p class="par">The flying machines which were constructed from 1920 to
1999 on the Langley plan, were built of Nickalum, an alloy of aluminum,
crystalized, within a magnetic field. The specific gravity of Nickalum,
as employed in the manufacture of &aelig;rodromes, or flying machines,
was .512. It was lighter than a thin strip of pine wood, malleable as
gold and impenetrable as steel. &AElig;rodromes could not have been
successfully manufactured in 1920 if Nickalum had not been employed in
their construction.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This new property was one of the marvelous products of
the twentieth century. It was employed in nearly everything which
required strength and elasticity. It was so malleable that waterproof
garments, overcoats and shoes were manufactured of Nickalum as early as
the year 1912.</p>
<p class="par">With this wonderful and cheaply manufactured metal,
&aelig;rial navigation became a <span class=
"marginnote">&AElig;rodromes of Nickalum.</span> possibility. The old
fashion days of silk balloons drifting helplessly on air currents, had
long passed away. These pre-Adamite curiosities belonged to the period
of the nineteenth century, when man was yet living under primitive
conditions, though by no means in a state of innocence.</p>
<p class="par">&AElig;rodromes constructed of Nickalum were largely
employed for traveling and commercial purposes between 1920 and 1925,
while in 1999 they had reached a high stage of perfection.
&AElig;rodromes weighing four hundred pounds only, in 1925, could
easily carry ten persons and cleave their way like an arrow through a
high wind. Small &aelig;rodromes carrying four persons, weighed only
one hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="par">If the wind were favorable on their regular trips, the
high grade express <span class="corr" id="xd21e1501" title=

popular Sky-Scraper line, could easily make the trip from Manhattan
(formerly New York) to Washington, in the State <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>of
Mexico, a distance of 1,949 miles in a direct air-line, in fifteen
hours, making brief stops for meals at Columbia, D. C., (formerly
called Washington) and at New Orleans. From the Crescent City it was
only a short run across the deep, blue gulf, to Vera Cruz, then
followed a short spurt of two hundred miles west of Vera Cruz to the
national capital, Washington, then built upon the site of the ancient
Aztec City of Mexico. In 1999 this was regarded as a neat, breezy
little trip.</p>
<p class="par">The name of New York city (always a meaningless and
unpopular one), had been <span class="marginnote">The Great City of
Manhattan.</span> changed in 1912 to the more appropriate one of
Manhattan. Its population in 1999 had increased to 25,000,000 souls.
Although the largest metropolis of the world, Manhattan in 1999 had
reached its zenith.</p>
<p class="par">The consolidation of the republics into one vast
American Union, from Alaska to Patagonia, and the removal of Washington
as the seat of our national government, from the little District of
Columbia to a more central and appropriate location in the State of
Mexico, as well as the opening of the Nicaragua Canal, were the leading
factors that contributed to the commercial detriment and undoing of
Manhattan. The star of destiny shone brightly over Mexico as the
conspicuous centre of the new and great American Republic and the
volume of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>the world&rsquo;s trade passed through the
Nicaragua Canal, diverting millions of freightage that otherwise must
have entered the port of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="par">The great air-ship or &aelig;rodrome building centre in
1999 was the city of Manhattan. Upon the Palisades, opposite
Grant&rsquo;s tomb and about one mile east of the lofty Dewey monument,
were stationed vast workshops for building these beautiful and graceful
&aelig;rodromes. It was ever a fascinating sight to the men and women
of 1999 to see one of these flying machines starting out of the shops
on its trial trip. The body of the &aelig;rodrome was resplendent in
brilliant colors and the new airships always appeared in the bravery of
bunting and silk flags.</p>
<p class="par">By act of Congress all &aelig;rial navigation companies
were obliged to adopt a certain color and number. The big express lines
running from Manhattan to Rio Janeiro and Mexico, each adopted a
prismatic color along with their official number. The object of this
was to enable people to distinguish at sight an approaching
&aelig;rodrome and at once recognize by its color the &aelig;rial line
to which it belonged.</p>
<p class="par">The U. S. of the A. &aelig;rial express ships alone were
permitted to use white paint on <span class="marginnote">Uncle
Sam&rsquo;s Favorite Color.</span> the hull of their &aelig;rodromes.
Thousands of them were employed in the government service and conveyed
troops to all points in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>great American Republic. It was,
however, strictly forbidden, under severe penalties, to carry any
munitions of war or any explosives or chemicals upon any &aelig;rial
ship whatever. The color of black was employed only on funeral
occasions. The &aelig;rodrome, which filled the functions of an
&aelig;rial hearse in 1999, was painted all black, hull and sails as
well. When the eye could discern floating in the air and moving swiftly
in one direction a long line of black &aelig;rodromes, it became known
that one more poor mortal had entered into rest, and his remains were
speeding through the air to their last resting place, namely, the
nearest crematory; burials of the old style having been prohibited by
act of Congress in 1947 throughout the United States of the
Americas.</p>
<p class="par">It was a really thrilling sight to see the large
&aelig;rodromes in their brilliant colors sailing through the air with
such swiftness and graceful ease, each one carrying over its stern the
flag of the great Republic with its eighty-five stars. Like beautiful
phantoms they flitted by, gracefully, noiselessly, swiftly cleaving the
air without the least apparent effort. It was an inspiring sight.</p>
<p class="par">Bridal couples in 1999 were frequently married in an
&aelig;rodrome as it rested on a <span class="marginnote">Airship
Wedding in 1999.</span> city square or in a modest village green.
Standing around the airship, which was always decorated with
multi-colored flags and floral designs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>were invited guests,
friends and spectators. After the ceremony was over and congratulations
exchanged, the minister, as well as the nearest relatives alighted from
the &aelig;rodrome, which immediately commenced to ascend amidst the
hand-clappings, hurrahs and Godspeeds of the gathering. As the
&aelig;rodrome gracefully arose about ten feet above terra firma, a few
handsful of rice were thrown at the happy pair, who retaliated by
throwing roses and other flowers at their friends below. When the
&aelig;rodrome attained a height of about one hundred feet, the
navigator steered the &aelig;rial ship in the direction required and
the journey then commenced.</p>
<p class="par">The trip across the continent in an &aelig;rial ship was
always, in pleasant weather, a delightful experience. A voyage from
Manhattan (formerly New York), to San Francisco, was a matter of about
thirty-six hours, with stops at Chicago, Omaha and Denver. Sailing
through balmy summer skies, with a continent at one&rsquo;s feet, was
an experience never to be forgotten. It was exhilarating to glide
unchecked, without noise or friction, dust or smoke, over lakes,
valleys, plains and mountains. All sense of danger or fear was banished
from the mind.</p>
<p class="par">At night the &aelig;rodromes were compelled by law to
travel at halt speed, with two searchlights, fore and aft, in constant
operation. The port lights of all &aelig;rodromes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>were
red, and the starboard lights were green. These precautions were
rendered necessary in order to avoid mid-air collisions. Some disasters
in 1999 filled the <span class="marginnote">&AElig;rodrome Collisions
in Mid-air.</span> country with alarm. In 1940 a terrible mid-air
collision occurred over Rio Janeiro. Two swift &aelig;rodromes,
attached to the Mercury Limited express, collided about 2,000 feet over
that city causing a serious loss of life. Collision in mid-air was
always the nightmare and dread of &aelig;rial navigation. People in
1999 had not yet become fully reconciled to the delightful sensation of
dropping out of the clouds and getting their clothes torn on church
steeples and lightning rods. When they made a start for heaven they
were better prepared to make it from earth as a starting point, rather
than making a break for paradise starting from the clouds.</p>
<p class="par">Accidents, unfortunately, were of frequent occurrence.

<p class="par">A heavy fog arising from the Susquehanna prevailed at

Cobleskill, who had just started for a trip to the Yellowstone Park,
fell on the statue of Justice on the dome of the Court House. At noon
his legs had not yet been extricated. The city is plunged in gloom.
Among the killed were five passengers from Sidney, Unadilla and
Bainbridge. The details of their death are too shocking for recital.
The bodies were taken to the Binghamton crematory and burned. The ashes

<p class="par">Terrible accidents like the one above described, taken
from the columns of the <i>Hourly Journal</i>, under date of July 17,
1984, were not by any means the only class of accidents caused in the
twentieth century by &aelig;rial navigation. Under the influences of
sighing breezes, an invigorating atmosphere and a mild, genial sun,
nothing could be more delightful than a mid-air excursion on board of
an &aelig;rodrome. Nothing could exceed the pleasant sensations one
experiences while noiselessly gliding over tree-tops and church
spires.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 courtships were no longer conducted in the

lover on an airship.</p>

utmost tension, and frightening horses with their &ldquo;bicycle

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It must not, however, be imagined that people in
1999 passed away their whole lives traveling in the air. Millions could
not be induced under any consideration, to plant a foot in any
&aelig;rial ship. They hugged old Mother Earth with a true devotion
worthy of a better cause. Many people in the year 1899 were to be found
who entertained strong antipathies against traveling on water, but in
1999 the opponents <span class="marginnote">Old Earth Good Enough for
Them.</span> of &aelig;rial navigation outnumbered them one hundred to
one. For this and other more important reasons, the genius of the
twentieth century applied itself assiduously to the perfecting of
electrical and compressed air machines of every conceivable
character.</p>
<p class="par">The twentieth century saw the coup-de-gr&acirc;ce, or
death blow, given to sails for propelling ships, horses used for
traction purposes and steam in mechanical engineering. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>Electricity, drawn directly from coal, as well
as the air, was procurable in inexhaustible quantities. Electricity
long before 1999 was stored with the utmost ease and economy, and
shipped all over the world for lighting, heating and motive power. The
partnership existing between the old-fashion steam engine and electric
dynamos was dissolved forever in 1920. Electricity conducted the
business alone and in its own name after steam and its clumsy
accessories withdrew from the firm.</p>
<p class="par">One of the first to feel the effects of the <span class=
"marginnote">Good-bye Mr. Horse.</span> change was that greatly admired
and beloved creature, the horse. In 1999 plenty of horses were yet to
be found in the haunts of civilization. They were generally kept as
pets, gentle, graceful and docile creatures, reminders of past
centuries in which their progenitors had so laboriously served the ends
of man. Occasionally in 1999 some old-fashioned swell, who had been
acquainted with horses and their ways in 1930, would occasionally
harness up a pair to a curious looking vehicle with shafts and take a
short drive, but in 1999 such antiquities were regarded with the same
curiosity Noah might have experienced could he have seen an
&aelig;rodrome circling around the ark. Out in the country, in remote
districts and mountain regions, horses were occasionally seen doing
farm work, but the sight was an unusual one, invariably <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>attracting much attention. It was estimated in
1999 that in about one hundred more years the horse in cities and
country towns would become as rare as the buffalo.</p>
<p class="par">In 1930 when the horse had already ceased to be a beast
of burden, epicures openly accepted its flesh as a highly esteemed
dish. Indeed it became quite the fad for fast swells to dine on trotter
steak. The dray and carriage horses were the first ones to disappear,
but the racers held on pretty well. In 1942 the turf and paddock were
still popular, though rapidly declining.</p>
<p class="par">The competitors that drove the horse from its field of
labor were the electric and compressed air horseless vehicles. As early
as 1899 the horseless carriage was rapidly striding into popularity. In
1920 they were common sights everywhere. In 1950 they had crowded the
horse to the wall and in 1999 horseless vehicles for business or
pleasure were exclusively employed everywhere.</p>
<p class="par">Horses in 1999 were no longer beasts of burden in the
great American Republic. <span class="marginnote">Emancipated by
Electricity.</span> They had been emancipated by electricity and
compressed air. In remote sections of the American Republic, like the
pampas of the State of Brazil and the mountain regions of the State of
Peru, horses were frequently to be seen, but seldom employed as beasts
of burden. It took many centuries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132"
href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>to wipe the equine race from
the face of the globe. The history and achievements of the noble brute
had been for many centuries linked to that of man. In 1999 the Arab
still loved his faithful charger, guarding it as the apple of his eye.
The noble animal still shared his tent. In his estimation a wife or two
were of little worth compared with the swift, graceful animal that so
often carried him from danger and left his pursuers in the rear. It
would have been sad indeed for the world, so early as 1999 to lose an
animal endowed by nature with so much intelligence, an animal that
again and again had decided a thousand fields of battle and had braved
all dangers by land or sea. But from the thraldom of labor, the horse
in 1999 had been emancipated and this tribute was one worthy of his
peerless fame.</p>
<p class="par">Even the reindeer of the Polar regions felt the touch of
twentieth century genius. The Laplander had no further use for the
dog-power of his ancestors. His sleds glided along the fields of ice,
propelled by electricity, of which inexhaustible supplies were drawn
from the aurora borealis.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 automobiles required only three days to traverse
the distance from Montreal in the American State of East Canada to
Washington, our national capital in the State of Mexico. The roads
throughout the Americas had reached a high grade of perfection
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>and travel on electric automobiles <span class=
"marginnote">Good Roads Everywhere.</span> became a pleasure even in
all the Southern States of the American Union, such as Venezuela,
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and <span class="corr" id="xd21e1691"
title="Source: Argentine">Argentina</span>. Uncle Sam&rsquo;s farm in
1999 was a big one and was covered with good roads. Horses and steam
engines were altogether too slow for the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="par">The exclusion of steam from all railroads in 1999 proved
a great boon to travel. Railroad smoke was a drawback to steam roads,
while sparks, cinders and live coal were a constant danger to property.
When a happy bride and groom took their departure on a train for their
honeymoon in 1899 their friends pelted them with rice, while the old
fashion steam engine attached to the train rounded the compliment by
pelting the newly wedded pair with cinders and soot. Dense volumes of
black smoke <span class="marginnote">Delights of Steam Travel.</span>
poured into the railway coaches, filling every crevice and corner,
rendering the human face unrecognizable. Travelers in these
old-fashioned cars, clad in the bravery of fashion, in their silks and
fine raiment, would journey only a short distance when they would
become almost unrecognizable from the torrents of black soft-coal smoke
that pierced their cuticle and darkened their lives. It was hard to
determine at the end <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>of a brief journey of a thousand miles
whether the white man who bought a through ticket in New York was a
Caucasian or an Ethiopian when he landed in Chicago, so dense was the
smoke through which he had traveled.</p>
<p class="par">The delightful atmosphere of a tunnel formed one of the
great attractions of steam travel in the good old days of 1899. Our
unhappy American travelers while journeying on these steam roads would
suddenly be rushed into a black hole, the damp and foul air of which
was enough to kill a salamander, filled with smoke and asphyxiating
gases. The marvel is that one-half of the people ever pulled through a
tunnel alive.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 these monstrosities of steam railroad
<span class="marginnote">The Single Rail is King.</span> travel were
entirely done away with. Not a steam engine was anywhere to be found.
The single rail electric railroad was monarch of all it surveyed, and
there were none to dispute its sway. It ruled the universe. The
new-born electrical power drew its forces from the air. Electricity was
greater than light itself. Its rule was felt by day as well as by
night.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 when an electric train dashed through a tunnel,
its arch was aglow with electric fire, rendering the passage light as
at noon time in a blazing sun. A touch of the button turned on every
light in the coaches. The air of the tunnel, instead of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>being black with smoke and noxious vapors, was
pure as the open air. Travel was rendered delightful in these
swift-speeding trains on the single-rail electric railroads, which
easily maintained a speed of two miles per minute. In point of speed
they were easily outwinged by the &aelig;rodromes, but for all that,
grass did not have much time to grow under the gearing of any electric
car in 1999.</p>
<p class="par">These single-track electric railroads covered the
Americas like a network of cob-webs. They were much safer than the
two-track system of railroads peculiar to the old period of 1899, when
steam engines, going around curves at two miles per minute, were liable
to lose their heads and lay down in the ditch to try and figure out
where they were at. The single rail upon which the electric car was
balanced in 1999, was built about three feet above the track. The cars
were so constructed that <span class="marginnote">Two Miles per
Minute.</span> the wheels ran along their whole length, the sides of
the car being built to a point about two feet below the rail. The
trolley wire overhead gave more steadiness to the car. It could not
upset.</p>
<p class="par">Through lines from Chicago to Washington, in the State
of Mexico, attained high speed, as well as the electric lines that
crossed the isthmus from the State of Mexico to Rio Janeiro. It
frequently happened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>that strawberries gathered at the base of
Mt. Orizaba, in Mexico, were delivered in Chicago in season for supper
the same day. Fish of highly esteemed flavor that were swimming in the
bay of Vera Cruz at break of day were frequently placed on ice and
reached Manhattan in time for dinner at seven p. m. the same day.</p>

flagship &ldquo;Victory&rdquo; and informed that gallant sailor that in
1899 warships would navigate without sails; that powder would be used
that made no smoke; that heavy rifles would hurl a ton shell fourteen
miles, would have been dropped overboard as a monumental liar.</p>
<p class="par">The age in which we live is always a conceited one;

bumps are smoothed down one <span class="corr" id="xd21e1744" title=
"Source: by by">by</span> one, is really interesting. The stage coach
was king in its day. As men gazed upon the lumbering, six miles per
hour coach, the bump of the period made them believe it was the
swiftest and most luxurious mode of travel the world would ever see.
Steam came and reduced the stage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138"
href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>coach bump. When men saw
steam locomotives drawing fast trains and covering the country with
villainous smoke, they really believed it was the swiftest mode of
travel the world ever would employ. Electricity then appeared and
reduced the steam bump.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 electricity became a mighty monarch and an
obedient slave. It ruled and <span class="marginnote">A Lively
Customer.</span> it obeyed. This lively king of the twentieth century
was a hustler. Sixteen distinct trips around the globe it could make in
just one second&rsquo;s time. Electric railroads and flying machines
could not reasonably hope to make sixteen separate trips around the
globe in one second&rsquo;s time. The age of 1999 was a very rapid one,
but its joints were too rheumatic to attempt any such gait. A traveler
hustling around the world at the rate of sixteen times per second would
hardly have time to visit and shake hands with friends.</p>
<p class="par">In the twentieth century electricity, the servant-king
of the world, was harnessed <span class="marginnote">All Done by
Electricity.</span> to everything conceivable. Everything was done by
merely pressing a button. Houses built in that period had no stairs.
Every private house had its elevator. Press a button and up it went.
Houses built in that period had no chimneys. All heating and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>every bit of the cooking was done by
electricity. If you wanted heat, press a button; more heat wanted,
press two. Locks and keys also became relics of a past age. No one in
1999 ever locked his house. Every house was provided with an electrical
outfit. Those who desired to leave the house for a few hours attached
the electric gongs and alarm bells. When connection was made no one
could leave or enter the house without raising a pandemonium and
sending an alarm to the central police station.</p>
<p class="par">The uses of electricity in 1999 were carried to even
absurd lengths. Man&rsquo;s most faithful, but, alas, uncertain friend,
the dog, was in evidence throughout the twentieth century. He wagged
his tail vigorously as ever in token of kindnesses received. He was as
ready as ever to sacrifice his life for that of his master, as well as
to plant his teeth into the calf of his leg. The Hindoo charmer is
never really safe until he has extracted the fangs of the reptile.</p>
<p class="par">And so it was with the twentieth century dog. Nothing
can be more violent than death by hydrophobia. The bite of the dog may
prove more terrible than that of the cobra. This scourge was
effectually removed. In 1999 dogs over one year old had their teeth
removed by electricity. Their mouths were then fitted with a false set.
During dog-days, while Sirius was in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>the ascendant, the
false teeth were removed and all canines were kept on a vegetable diet.
Hydrophobia became one of the lost arts.</p>
<p class="par">Another peculiar method in which electricity was
utilized in 1999 tended to rob <span class="marginnote">Electrical
Dentistry.</span> dentistry of some of its terrors. There was one
feature of dentistry in 1899 that often tested the best nerves, and
that was the peculiar odor common to all dental chambers of horror.
This peculiar odor settles like a cloud upon the stomach and seldom
appeals in vain to one&rsquo;s nerves for sympathy. For this reason an
electrical machine was invented in 1999 which enabled the patient to
remain at home while an offending tooth was tendering its resignation.
The dentist, during the operation, remained in his den, enjoying a
monopoly of its odors. If a tooth ached all one had to do was to call
up a dentist, on the telephone, and ask to be placed on the line. The
victim, in the seclusion of his back parlor, adjusted the electrical
forceps and signalled to the dentist, five blocks away, to touch it
off, then the festivities commenced. These private tooth extracting
s&eacute;ances became very popular. No profane eyes were there to
witness the agony of the victim, as in a public dental office. If he
shouted loud enough to make a hole in the sky or tried to kick the
plaster off the ceiling, no one was any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>the wiser for it. But
in a public dental office (especially with ladies in the adjoining
room), while the victim is being harpooned, his eloquent groans must be
stifled and no attempt must be made by the victim to kick at the
chandeliers. The new system of home electrical tooth extracting proved
very popular. It was one of the things that had come to stay.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999, through the medium of electricity, the
relations existing between creditors and debtors became closer and more
binding. <span class="marginnote">Sure Cure for Dead Beats.</span> In
1899, for some reason or other never fully explained, a debtor who had
a long standing account, was liable to dodge into some nook, corner or
side street, if he caught a glimpse of his creditor coming down the
road. The relations existing between creditor and debtor in the
nineteenth century were not as cordial as they should be. If the debt
were of long standing there lacked a certain warmth in their greeting
which was perhaps difficult to account for.</p>
<p class="par">In 1930 creditors and debtors adjusted themselves in
better harmony, at least they kept in closer electrical touch with one
another. If the sum due was $50 or over and of long standing, the law
allowed the creditor to connect his debtor with an electrical battery.
The object of this wise law was to keep the creditor in constant touch
with his debtor. If the debt was over three <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>months due, the creditor was allowed to
occasionally &ldquo;touch up&rdquo; his debtor without having to hunt
him up and dun him. The creditor always had him &ldquo;on the
string&rdquo; so to speak. It was further specified by law that
creditors must employ only as many volts as there were dollars due on
account in shocking a debtor. These electrical shocks were merely
reminders, intended to refresh the memory of the debtor. A man owing
$200 was liable to receive two hundred volts until the debt was
satisfied.</p>
<p class="par">This plan for the collection of bad debts worked very
successfully. In 1999 no <span class="marginnote">Worked Like a
Charm.</span> debtor could tell when his creditor might touch him up.
The shock reminding him of his old debt might come during the night and
disturb his pleasant dreams. Perhaps while seated at the family table,
or perhaps even while engaged in family worship, an electric shock
might come that would raise him three feet off the floor. Such little
occurrences were rather embarrassing, especially if the debtor was
talking at the time to some lady friend. A man owing $500 was in danger
of his life. His creditor was liable to dun him by giving him a shock
of five hundred volts. Such sensations, certainly, are not as pleasant
as watching a yacht race, with your boat an easy winner.</p>
<p class="par">A curious illustration of the operation of this new
condition between creditors and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>bad debtors, by which the
former had an electrical control of the latter, came to light in a
parish church on the banks of the St. Lawrence. It appears that the
village school teacher, who was also choir-master, was busy with a
Saturday evening rehearsal. The members of the choir were in their
places, while the professor stood near the communion-rail, facing the
choir, with his back turned towards the empty pews. He was speaking,
when suddenly his red hair stood on end, his whiskers straightened out
at right angles, while his eyes looked big as door knobs. He then gave
a leap in the air, turned a somersault backwards and cleared ten pews
before landing again on his feet. It appears that he owed his landlord
an old board bill of $120 and the latter had just given him an
electrical dun. The choir was astounded at the professor&rsquo;s
performance. The latter excused himself and merely said it was a slight
attack of grip.</p>
<p class="par">In 1942 any one who used the word
&ldquo;steamship&rdquo; was immediately rated a back number. A few of
them, it is true, still fouled the ocean with their villainous smoke,
but in 1999 the electrical ship ploughed the briny waters. It was a
grand sight to see a magnificent ship nine hundred feet in length
propelled through the waters at a <span class="marginnote">Electrical
Ocean Navigation.</span> rate of thirty-five knots per hour by an
invisible power, a mighty giant encased in the interior of the ship, a
power that labored silently yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144"
href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>swiftly, with no perceptible
vibration to the vessel and without emitting volumes of black smoke.
These swiftly moving electrical ships were strange and striking in
their appearance. Those constructed in 1975 by the Cramps had no masts,
and they, of course, had no more use for funnels than a hen has for
teeth. To the people of the old school of 1899, the ocean electrical
ship looked strange indeed. The spectacle of a large steamship of
28,000 tons burden cleaving the ocean waves at the rate of forty knots
per hour, with no masts and no smokestacks, looked strangely to men in
1975 who had been accustomed in their youth to old fashioned steamships
like the City of New York, Campagnia, Kaiser Wilhelm der <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1800" title="Source: Gros">Grosse</span>, F&uuml;rst
Bismarck, Teutonic and others of that class. In 1975 the hull of the
electrical ship retained practically the same old lines. An electrical
ship, like the Great Republic, built in the year last named, plying
between Manhattan and Liverpool, was a trifle over nine hundred feet
long, with only <span class="corr" id="xd21e1803" title=
"Source: eight-two">eighty-two</span> feet breadth of beam. From stem
to stern was built a swell body roof which covered the entire deck of
the vessel. This covering was supported by ornamental iron columns from
the bulwarks and usually stood about twenty feet above the deck. The
only object that arose above the deck-roof was the captain&rsquo;s
bridge, in which was stationed the steersman, who steered the leviathan
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>merely pressing electrical buttons on a small
disc in front of him. With the masts and funnels removed from an
electrical ocean ship, much valuable room was thus secured, adding
greatly to the comfort of the passengers.</p>
<p class="par">Electricity was pressed into every conceivable service.
That wonderful element <span class="marginnote">Lighting Up the
Atlantic.</span> was man&rsquo;s best and most faithful servant. There
was no duty in the twentieth century too menial for it to do. It
transformed our ocean, lake and river craft into a blaze of light by
night. Collisions after dark were unknown to navigation in 1975. At a
distance of ten miles out at sea an electrical vessel looked like a
solid mass of moving flame. Electricity drawn directly from the air and
extracted from coal, costs practically nothing. The chief item of
expenditure was to maintain the electrical machines in repair. In 1899
sailing ships moved along at a snail gait and during night time a small
green and red lamp on the port and starboard sides of the ship was all
that enabled other vessels to note their presence. It was always the
marvel of that age that a hundred collisions did not take place every
night on the Atlantic. But in 1999 not a sail or steamship was anywhere
to be seen, on ocean, lake or river. Electricity was cheaper, swifter
and more reliable.</p>
<p class="par">In 1899 so backward was the age that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>small boats, called row-boats, were still
propelled with oars. In that year those primitive people still employed
the old methods of propelling a boat that were in vogue in the days of
the Phoenicians and Vikings. They still rowed a boat in the manner of
the Greek galley slaves. In 1930 seamen had no more use for oars than a
sperm whale has for paddle-wheels. Everything that could float, from a
wash-tub to a man-of-war, was propelled by electricity. Even toy boats,
sold for $5, were propelled by electricity. The winds still raged in
1999. From zephyr to cyclone that element ruled over the surface of the
globe, but man had little use for it. Even the staid Hollander
harnessed the wind no more. His mills were run by electricity, while
the same agency was continually at work pumping out his dykes.</p>
<p class="par">Through the agency of electricity navigation in the
twentieth century was rendered much safer. The ocean by night was
dotted with electric buoys, which tossed and bowed with every wave. On
these buoys signal-lights were placed, and passing vessels could read
the latitude and longitude in which they were in at any time of the
day. The figures were plainly marked on each buoy. By night the
Atlantic ocean between Sandy Hook and Daunt&rsquo;s Rock was dotted
with bright electric arc lights of 8,000 c. p. The eye never wearied
gazing upon the picturesque beauty of the scene. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The effect of these brilliant lights on the broad bosom
of the ocean, especially during <span class="marginnote">A Scene of
Thrilling Beauty.</span> a storm, was grand beyond the power of pen to
describe. A distant wave could be clearly seen approaching one of these
electric, mid-ocean buoys. On it sweeps, a tremendous current that no
human power could stem. The rugged blue wall of the great wave glistens
in the dazzling electric light as its huge side and foaming crest
reaches the electric buoy. It seems as though the light and buoy must
be swept to destruction and buried from sight. As the great wave sweeps
over the light, all becomes dark for a few seconds, but when the mighty
billow has swept on, the electric arc again blazes forth in the trough
of the sea bidding defiance to Neptune&rsquo;s frowns. These mighty
mid-ocean scenes, viewed from the deck of an electric ocean greyhound,
were thrilling in the extreme.</p>
<p class="par">Along the great chain of coast-line of the United States
of the Americas, from the State of Maine to the States of Venezuela,
Brazil and Patagonia, also on the Pacific slope from the States of
Chile, Peru and Colombia to the States of West Canada and Alaska, every
rock or promontory dangerous to navigation, was ablaze with electric
beacons. Electricity was common as air. Oceans and continents were made
more habitable to man. It became in 1999 the world&rsquo;s sun by
night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The perfect and absolute control of electricity by the
scientists of the twentieth century benefited both &aelig;rial and
ocean navigation, in furnishing the motive power. But these were
benefited in another and hardly less remarkable manner by the perfected
Marconi system of wireless telegraphy, which in the nineteenth century
was comparatively unknown and in its early experimental stage. In
&aelig;rial and ocean navigation wireless telegraphy proved an
invaluable aid. The bright, young Italian inventor became a benefactor
of the human race. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"

<h2 class="main">Wireless Telegraphy.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">The great advantages of wireless telegraphy in
navigation. Ships are enabled to communicate with shore during voyages.
Messages received and sent at any time en route. Collisions at sea
reported at once. Belated steamers cause no anxiety.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the old-fashioned days of sails and steam, when
a vessel left port and passed out of sight, she instantly became a
whole world in herself. Communication had been severed with the outer
world. The condition of a sailing vessel during a calm was a picture of
helplessness. Steamships were more self-reliant&mdash;they at least
controlled their own course. But both classes of ships, whether
propelled by sail or steam, once out of sight of land, were temporarily
shut out from the busy world.</p>
<p class="par">During these enforced absences upon an ocean voyage,
great events frequently happened of which passengers, officers and
crews were necessarily ignorant of. At the <span class=
"marginnote">Shut Out of the World.</span> termination of a long or
short voyage, the first news could only be obtained from the pilot-boat
which met the approaching vessel far out at sea. War might be on the
eve of declaration as the vessel left port, battles might be fought,
the enemy might be vanquished and even peace declared and a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>knowledge of all these events would only reach
the tardy mariner upon the arrival of the vessel at her port of
destination.</p>
<p class="par">Such a condition of affairs, often the cause of the
deepest anxieties on the part of ocean travelers, might answer well
enough for the days of the Crusaders, when kings of Great Britain went
to Palestine to battle for the Cross, and never again heard from home
in three or four years&rsquo; time. When Napoleon, that meteor of the
nineteenth century, left the shores of <i>la belle France</i> for the
rocky desolation of St. Helena, it was over a year before he received
any news from Paris. The same conditions ruled in 1899. Steam had
rendered ocean voyages shorter and more punctual. But the main
difficulty still existed. Passengers on our ocean-liners during a
voyage knew as little of occurrences at home as those who traveled in
the days of the Vikings and Crusaders. In this respect (as in many
others), the world in 1899 was no better off than in the days when the
Roman legions landed on the shores of Britain. The nineteenth century
and the centuries before Christ were upon equal footing in this
respect.</p>
<p class="par">Many splendidly equipped steamships, with colors flying
and bands playing left port in the old days of sails and steam, with
multitudes waving their adieux and heartily wishing them God-speed and
were never again heard from. No communication was possible in those
days between land <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>and vessels at sea. Sometimes they were
<span class="marginnote">Into the Jaws of Death.</span> doomed in the
cold embrace of an iceberg; an occasional collision sent hundreds of
souls to their final account; fire, always dreaded on the ocean, caused
many to suffer the horrors of thirst and starvation; the ocean claimed
its victims in many dreadful forms and no tidings ever reached home of
the fate of loved ones, because communication between ship and shore in
the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; of 1899, was impossible. This supreme
difficulty had not yet been overcome in 1899, and the defect was
universally regarded as being a most deplorable one. The only
communication ever maintained between vessels in mid-ocean and the main
shore in the nineteenth century was done by cable-ships, while actually
engaged in laying an ocean cable. The Great Eastern was the first
steamship to lay claim to this distinction, when in 1867, her officers
fished up and brought to the surface the broken Atlantic cable and the
great news was flashed from ship to shore.</p>
<p class="par">Vessels in these days of the nineteenth century only too
often left port never again <span class="marginnote">A Very Backward
Age.</span> to be seen by mortal man. Loved ones plunged into a watery
grave, locked in each other&rsquo;s embrace, and none survived to tell
the fearful tale. Communication with shore was unknown <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>in
the vaunted civilization of the nineteenth century. The fate of the
Naronic, of the White Star line, looms up in evidence. Not a whisper
was again heard of her after she left port. The City of <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1867" title="Source: Glascow">Glasgow</span> in 1854
sank in Neptune&rsquo;s pastures. Four hundred and eighty souls went
down in that brave ship. No hint, however slight, was ever heard of
her. The Ocean Monarch, the Pacific of the Collins line, and the
ill-fated City of Boston, all suffered fates that none but the day of
judgment can reveal.</p>
<p class="par">This confession of weakness, this serious drawback of
the nineteenth century, which added to the terrors of those &ldquo;who
go down into the great deep,&rdquo; was fortunately not shared by the
advanced sciences and arts of the twentieth century. Wireless
telegraphy contributed almost as much to the comfort of ocean and
&aelig;rial navigation as electricity. Telegraph poles that rendered
hideous some of our most beautiful avenues and the antiquated ocean
cables were entirely relegated into oblivion. The former went into the
scrap heap, while the latter found their way into Davy Jones&rsquo;
locker.</p>
<p class="par">Long before 1999 wireless telegraphy was employed on all
vessels on ocean, river and lake. Instant communication was at all
times maintained between ship and shore. <span class="marginnote">It
Opened a New Era.</span> War vessels at foreign stations made their
daily reports in 1999 to the Navy Department in the State of Mexico.
All other navies of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>world enjoyed the same facilities.
Relatives telegraphed to their families and friends from vessels in
mid-ocean. It was quite common to receive a brief message from an
Atlantic liner two thousand miles east of Sandy Hook, as follows:</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Overdue vessels in 1999 gave no anxiety in that era of
progress. If a shaft broke the home office was at once notified that
the vessel would be several days behind her schedule time in arriving
at her destination. If caught in a fog or obliged to move at half
speed, the information was immediately lodged on shore. In fact it even
became possible to navigate vessels from the shore.</p>
<p class="par">In 1982 the strange experiment was made of navigating a
large ocean electric ship <span class="marginnote">Sailed his Ship from
Land.</span> from Manhattan (old N. Y.), to Queenstown. The name of the
vessel was the City of Sidney. After the pilot had dropped off at the
Hook, Captain Sherman, of the Electric Belt Line of vessels, remained
in his private office in the forty-third story of Anti-Trust building
on 59th street, Manhattan, and issued his commands by wireless
telegraph to the first officer of the City of Sidney. Reports
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>reached the captain every six hours, giving the
exact latitude and longitude and the ship&rsquo;s course was directed
from the captain&rsquo;s private office on 59th street in the city of
Manhattan. In other words it was the city of Manhattan that kept the
City of Sidney on the move, so to speak. The ship&rsquo;s course,
conduct of the crew, the health of the passengers, the reports of
passing electrical vessels, the velocity of wind and other details of
navigation, were communicated to Captain Sherman, whose orders were
given and obeyed as readily as though issued from the bridge or deck of
the City of Sidney. When that vessel arrived off Queenstown to land the
U. S. of the A. mails, Capt. Sherman in 59th street ordered half speed
and finally stopped the electric engines. Of course, while navigating
his immense vessel across the ocean and remaining seated in his office
at home, Captain Sherman could not assume his place in the saloon at
the head of the table. Wireless telegraphy could not, with all its
ingenuity, satisfy one&rsquo;s appetite at the sumptuous dinners served
on board the City of Sidney. But this demonstrated to the world in 1982
that with wireless telegraphy commanders could remain in their office
on shore and sail their ships to foreign ports in perfect safety. This
was done in 1982 just as easily as the old style train <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1907" title="Source: despatcher">dispatcher</span>
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1910" title=
"Source: controled">controlled</span> far away trains in 1899 while
seated in his own office. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=
"#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Marconi system of wireless telegraphy, when
perfected in 1920, employed the Hertzian magnetic waves, which are
identical with the waves of light. Whenever an electric spark is made
to leap from one electrode to another, one of these waves is created.
The Marconi instruments for sending and receiving are tuned to each
other and are then invulnerable to the attack of waves of different
lengths.</p>
<p class="par">These rays of electricity are reflected and directed in
a given direction like rays of <span class="marginnote">A Marvelous
Invention.</span> light. An electric circuit with a key, gives the
basis of the Marconi system. This circuit runs through a spark coil
with an oscillator to produce continuous electric sparking so long as
the circuit is kept closed by the key&mdash;and from this the sparking
wires run out of doors to the pole from which the messages are
sent.</p>
<p class="par">One end of the wire is placed in the earth and the other
is elevated in the air. The height to which it is carried determines
the distance to which the messages may be sent. The operator presses
his key as in ordinary telegraphing, making his alphabet in dots and
dashes. As the waves shoot out and reach the distant station, the
filings in the tube cohere and the current passing through them draws
up the armature of the relay magnet. This closes the circuit of the
recording instrument. It is broken constantly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>by
the tapper and instantly re-established by receiving waves.</p>
<p class="par">The towers employed in 1920 for the transmission of
wireless messages were very high. The manifest advantages of the system
were apparent and long before 1930 wireless telegraphy came into
general use. The new system proved the death-knell of telegraph poles,
as well as ocean cables. Old telegraph stock faded in value like the
morning mist. The supreme importance of communicating with vessels
while at sea alone guaranteed the success of the wireless system.</p>
<p class="par">Wireless telegraphy proved to be one of the crowning
scientific achievements of the twentieth century, but the ambition of
scientists <span class="marginnote">Chatting with the Boys in
Mars.</span> in 1969 knew no bounds. In that year they were busy
sending messages to Mars, utilizing starbeams for that purpose. For
thirty long years they repeated the same messages or signals to Mars
every night. In 1999 the canalers up in that bright Yankee planet had
not yet responded but hope was still entertained that some sign of
recognition might yet be secured from the Martians.</p>
<p class="par">Telescopes in 1999 had been vastly improved. The network
of canals in Mars became far more distinct to the human eye. The moon,
our nearest neighbor, looked as though only one mile away. Neptune, the
giant of the heavens, grew on more intimate <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>terms with our mother Earth, but on Mars was
centered the greatest attention. Fervent were the hopes that Martians
would acknowledge the ceaseless signals sent from earth.</p>
<p class="par">The growth of the electrical machine industry in 1999
was enormous. The United States of the Americas led the world in their
manufacture. The dawn of this vast industry was already manifest, even
in 1899. The capital invested in electrical industries in that year was

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The great innovation of the twentieth century
which long rankled within the human breast, but finally uprooted and
conquered prejudice, was cremation. The <span class="marginnote">No
More &ldquo;Earth to Earth.&rdquo;</span> old traditions and forms of
Christian burial were difficult to eradicate, but reason and a general
sense of public safety finally broke down the barriers and traditions
of ages. Cremation for many years shocked public sensibilities. The
terrors of the hidden grave, nameless and horrible, were eliminated by
the new and only safe process of disposing of the dead. In the
contention which prevailed during the first half of the twentieth
century, many were reluctant to accept cremation as the true mode of
burial. By degrees, however, public opinion settled down and adjusting
itself to the new conditions, accepted the quicker and safer methods of
burial. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Cremation in 1999 became the only legalized form of
burial. Every cemetery was <span class="marginnote">Cremation Became a
Law.</span> provided with a crematory long before 1950. Electricity was
employed in reducing the body to ashes. Grave robberies that so often
disgraced the nineteenth century, became impossible. A rich man was at
least sure of a safe burial of his ashes after cremation, while the
poor man&rsquo;s body, which formerly was thrust into a Potter&rsquo;s
field, was safe at last from medical students and professional
body-snatchers, who often robbed graves to <span class=
"marginnote">Rich and Poor on Equal Footing.</span> secure a skeleton.
Millionaires in the twentieth century enjoyed after death the same
degree of safety vouchsafed to the poor man. Their dust was on equal
footing.</p>
<p class="par">The old graves were left undisturbed in 1999. Graves in
that year, in the manner of their occupants, gradually passed into
decay. In the centre of every cemetery was constructed a fine
mausoleum, a pantheon in which the ashes of the dead were carefully
deposited in vaults or family receptacles. Cremation having become in
1999 the only mode of burial authorized by law, <span class=
"marginnote">The State pays for All Burials.</span> these mausoleums
were built at the expense of the town. Each vault was owned by a family
in perpetuity. Those who were too poor to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>purchase a vault had
their ashes placed in a common burial plot in the ground.</p>
<p class="par">These large mausoleums were built of white marble in a
style of architecture appropriate to the solemnity of their purpose.
The interior was well-lighted and ventilated and on the door of each
vault was carved the family name. All mausoleums were built about on
the same plan. From the centre of the structure arose a high dome of
beautifully chiseled white marble, while light poured from the top into
the circular floor of the structure. The vaults used as receptacles for
the ashes were stationed about in a large circle, in several tiers, one
above another. The ashes of the cremated body were deposited in a small
metallic box, 9 &times;18 inches, and four inches deep. On the cover
was engraved the name, age, date of death and cremation of the
deceased. Each family vault was capable of holding thirty metallic
cases, or burials.</p>
<p class="par">It was universally conceded that cremation was the only
safe and proper mode of <span class="marginnote">It Looked Heathenish
to Them.</span> disposing of the dead. In 1999 people wondered how the
ancient form of burial had so long been practiced by civilized nations.
When in 1999 cremation became the only legal form of burial, they
looked with feelings of horror upon the ancient form of interment. How
people could lay away their loved ones in the cold ground to remain for
years the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>companion of the worm, could not be understood
in the days of cremation. All arguments brought against burials in the
ground were unanswerable. It was an offense against the laws of
humanity, and the practice was maintained even as late as 1965, but
public opinion became firm against it. The revolt against burials
spread <span class="corr" id="xd21e2028" title=
"Source: raidly">rapidly</span>, once inaugurated.</p>
<p class="par">In 1965 a family that consented to the burial of their
dead was regarded not only <span class="marginnote">Guarding the Bodies
of Rich Men.</span> as a back number but with feelings of aversion. The
question arose in the minds of many if they really could love the
memory of their departed one and place the body where it was liable to
be stolen or desecrated; where it became the food of vermin. People in
1899 often had to even place strong guards over the tombs of rich
relatives for fear that vandals might steal the body and retain it for
ransom. Long after death bodies of men had been drawn from their tomb
and hanged by a mob. When in 1899 Lord Kitchner, the Sidar of the
British forces in Egypt, subdued and captured Khartoum, <span class=
"marginnote">Nineteenth Century Practices.</span> he permitted his men
to violate the tomb of the Mahdi. The body of the Prophet was torn from
its resting place and its head was decapitated. And this, note well,
was done by British soldiers in 1899, to avenge the cruel death of Gen.
Gordon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1999 desecrations, robberies and violations of graves
became impossible. The world was no longer shocked by such atrocities.
Hyenas, both biped and quadruped, were thrown out of business.
Cremation, the purest and swiftest mode of reducing the body to dust
and ashes, was universally declared to be immeasurably better than the
ancient mode of burial. The dead were not permitted to pollute the
ground and to infuse germs of diseases, deadly microbes, into living
springs of water. It matters <span class="marginnote">Everything For
and Nothing Against It.</span> little, in 1999, whether the cemetery
were situate on top of a hill, in a valley or in the midst of a crowded
city. The ashes they contained could pollute neither water, earth nor
air. A mausoleum or cemetery in 1999 was often built in the most
crowded or most fashionable section of a city. Cremation was
acknowledged to be a clean, wholesome method of burying the dead. Boys
in 1999 were not under the painful necessity while walking past a
cemetery at night to whistle to keep up their courage.</p>
<p class="par">In 1899 the popular idea about cremation was erroneous
and was largely the cause of prejudice against this method of disposing
of the dead. A vast number of people believed in that year that bodies
which were cremated were literally roasted or reduced to ashes over a
fierce fire. When people, however, began to learn the truth of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>matter, that cremated bodies were placed in the
retort of a crematory and were reduced to ashes by an exceedingly high
temperature and not touched in any manner by fire, then prejudice let
down the bars and cremations soon became common.</p>
<p class="par">As a result of cremation and the law of 1999 which
compelled its adoption as the only legal method of burial, undertakers
<span class="marginnote">Undertakers Wear Long Faces.</span> were
deprived of large revenues they often derived from the sale of caskets.
Caskets were no longer in demand because, as a wag in 1985 observed:
&ldquo;There is nobody to bury.&rdquo; A seven foot casket of the 1899
pattern, however gorgeous, would have been absurdly too large and
meaningless to enshrine the ashes of a departed relative. Such
contrivances were good enough in the backward age of the nineteenth
century. Burials in 1899 were made under ground, while in 1999 they
were all made above ground. In 1899, immediately after death in a
family one of the first duties was to purchase a casket and arrange
with an undertaker for the funeral. In their unhappy frame of mind,
with hearts bowed in grief, undertakers often made terms their own way
with mourners. Few mourners are in a state of mind to drive a bargain
in such moments, and they too often yield to the blandishments of the
suave casket-broker accepting any terms he may offer. Cremation did
away <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>with this, and unscrupulous undertakers had to
come off their perch.</p>
<p class="par">Hearses were not abolished in the days of cremation. The
style of the hearse entirely changed. In the place of the pompous
affair of 1899, bedecked in its towering plumes, rich in silver
appointments, massive <span class="marginnote">The Twentieth Century
Hearse.</span> structures covered with plate glass, driven by an
awe-inspiring individual perched on a high seat, the hearse of 1999 was
a far less pretentious affair. It weighed no more than a light, racing
sulky. It had four wheels. In the centre of the vehicle, which, of
course, was propelled by electricity, was constructed a small platform
about three feet square, the sides of which were elaborately trimmed in
gold and silver ornaments. The platform was covered by an open canopy
supported by four elaborate silver pillars. The metallic case
containing the ashes of the deceased seldom exceeded 9 &times; 18
inches, 4 inches deep, and weighed about four pounds. These metallic
cases were of exquisite designs, usually in highly burnished silver or
gold. Those which contained the ashes of the wealthier classes were
often covered with precious stones and brilliant gems, presenting a
most artistic and attractive appearance. These burial cases looked like
jewel-boxes of an elaborate pattern. In looking at them death was
robbed of its terrors. A beautiful jewel-case, 9 &times; 18 inches,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>containing the ashes of some loved one did not
strike one&rsquo;s imagination with the horror of a long burial casket
with its inanimate tenant.</p>
<p class="par">There was everything about cremation to appeal to
loftier ideals. The light, portable character of the little cremation
cases became more popular than the heavy casket. The heart-rending
accidents that too often occurred under the old system of burials,
became impossible in the brighter and better days of cremation. In 1899
it sometimes happened that in lowering a body into the grave the bottom
of the casket gave way. The rest can better be imagined than described.
It sometimes happened that <span class="marginnote">Sample Horrors of
1899.</span> while a funeral procession was on its way to the cemetery,
the hearse team got frightened. In the thrilling runaway that followed
the casket fell out of the hearse and breaking open the corpse rolled
out on the ground. The horror-stricken relatives and friends would
remember the sad scene through life, mentioning it only in
whispers.</p>
<p class="par">These horrors of the old-style, so-called Christian
burials, were rendered impossible in the cremation regime. Not that
alone, but cremation removed from earth the most horrible experience
that can be endured by mortal man and that is premature burial. The
practice of burying bodies is a relic of barbarism. Its horrors and
possibilities are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"
name="pb166">166</a>]</span>without limit. No civilized community
should tolerate it. Custom and tradition are the forces that maintain
it. It does not possess a single point in its favor, while, on the
other hand, there are scores of sound arguments against it.</p>
<p class="par">No person who ever spent a minute in the fierce
temperature of a crematory ever <span class="marginnote">Can&rsquo;t
Bury them Alive.</span> lived to tell the tale. The ancient method of
burial is not so certain&mdash;many cases have come to light where
people, supposed to be dead, revived after interment. Imagine the
horror of the situation. Can any human experience be more dreadful than
this one? Many cases have come to light in the nineteenth century
proving beyond a shadow of doubt that unfortunate men and women had
been buried alive. In graves opened many weeks after burial the
scratched face, torn hair and imprint of terror upon the features told
only too plainly what had happened and of the final anguish of the
unfortunate one. Such horrors were not possible in the cremation
process. If there is anything the world appreciates it&rsquo;s a
&ldquo;sure thing&rdquo;&mdash;and that salient feature of cremation
did not escape its attention.</p>
<p class="par">On the day following the death of a person, after the
remains had been viewed for the last time by relatives and friends, the
body was taken by night to the crematory where it was immediately
reduced to ashes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>These were carefully deposited in a small
metallic burial case and returned to the <span class="marginnote">No
Hurry for the Funeral.</span> mortuary residence. The date of the
funeral was agreed upon and notices were sent out to the public.
Sometimes it was deemed desirable to hold the funeral one or two months
after death. In cremation funerals everything passed off in the most
leisurely manner possible, accompanied with the highest effects of art.
A funeral could be held a week, a month or a year after death. There
was ample time to make arrangements, or to postpone a funeral on
account of the weather. On the day of interment when the ashes were to
be deposited in the family vault in the mausoleum, at the appointed
hour, friends and relatives gathered at the mortuary residence. The
small metallic casket containing the ashes of the deceased was usually
placed in the centre of the room, resting upon a light bamboo stand,
covered with black velvet. The stand was usually surrounded with choice
flowers and floral designs. The tiniest caskets used in the old burial
days were double in size of the beautiful silver and gold cases
sometimes holding the ashes of a person who might have weighed, during
life, over three hundred pounds. The absence of the large casket used
in old burial days and the substitution in its place of a small
jewel-size case containing the ashes was an agreeable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>innovation. Otherwise, all funeral services in
1999 were substantially the same as in 1899. Although the surroundings
were far more pleasant, the grief of the stricken ones was none the
less profound. When funerals in 1999 were held in a church, the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2087" title=
"Source: exersises">exercises</span> were about the same as in the days
of the old burial system. Instead of six bearers, only one became
necessary.</p>
<p class="par">There was a marked contrast between the funeral
processions of 1899 and those <span class="marginnote">Funeral
Procession in 1999.</span> of 1999. The great, cumbersome hearse had
disappeared, and in the line of carriages that followed the small,
light electric hearse, no horses were to be seen. All mourners&rsquo;
carriages were propelled by electricity. The automobile containing the
minister, led the procession, then followed the hearse and carriages of
the mourners. In 1999, when a funeral passed by, people on the streets
at the time were always careful to remove their hats as a mark of
respect to the ashes of the deceased. This was a concession to common
decency almost wholly unknown in the days of burials. People living in
1899 should not be too severely criticised in their lack of respect for
the dead in the matter of uncovering as a funeral procession passed by.
The entire system was a relic of barbarism and people were hardly to
blame for denying this mark of respect to such an objectionable mode of
burial. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It was at first thought that cremation would destroy the
sacred memories and observances <span class="marginnote">Memorial Day
in 1999.</span> of Memorial or Decoration Day. In a few years, however,
it was discovered that these fears were unfounded. People in 1999 were
loyal to the sacred memory of departed ones, and on Memorial days the
interior of the mausoleums and doors of the vaults were garlanded with
flowers, presenting a most beautiful appearance. The old graves of the
nineteenth and preceding centuries were still cared for by loving
hands.</p>
<p class="par">These were decorated as in the good old days of 1899 and
were not in anywise neglected. Many families in the twentieth century
took up the remains of their ancestors and caused them to be cremated
in order that their ashes might rest in the same vault. It was conceded
that the ashes could never perish in a vault and another supreme
advantage in favor of the cremation system arose from the fact that
they required no care.</p>
<p class="par">The abominations of the old fashioned burials were
apparently without limit. Under that barbaric system of the 19th
century, it might truly be said that after death a man had <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2105" title="Source: not">no</span> where to lay his
head. <span class="marginnote">Ejected for Non-Payment of Rent.</span>
One would think that after death a person had severed his connection
with the living world. Such was not the case. It often happened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>that men were taken out of their graves for
non-payment of rent. That is, the lease or care of the ground not
having been satisfied or paid, the ground or cemetery lot reverts to
the Association, who dislodge the body of the tenant and offer the
cemetery lot for sale to other parties. In the 19th century, especially
in European cities, it was a common practice to lease a grave for five
years, at the expiration of which period the grave was opened and the
skeletons deposited in underground catacombs or left to the tender
mercies of medical students. The barbarity of such practices,
sanctioned by the civilization of the 19th century, need not be dwelt
upon. Cremation removed the stigma of such unholiness from civilized
nations. The ashes of the dead required no material space and were
easily disposed of. No grave rentals or purchases were required in
their case.</p>
<p class="par">Last but not the least of the advantages of cremation
was the death blow it gave to <span class="marginnote">Spoils the Ghost
Business.</span> the ghost industry. Superstition tottered when in 1999
graveyards had been abolished by law, as well as custom. The stately,
white marble mausoleum which held the ashes of departed ones did not
possess the gruesome appearance of the old fashioned cemeteries of
1899, with mounds and graves scattered in every direction, some of them
in a condition of shameful neglect. There was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>something about a graveyard which was naturally
repellent to the living. The ones who scoffed the loudest at ghosts,
and were really very brave at noon time, were never favorably impressed
with the idea of spending a few hours alone at night in a cemetery.
When graveyards were abolished and bodies were promptly reduced to
ashes after death, superstition began to weaken. Many people who would
have been terrified at the suggestion of keeping a dead body in a house
any unusual length of time, did not hesitate in many instances, to keep
the ashes of several cremated members of the family for years, in their
parlor. Cremation removed the sting of death, robbing it of its
terrors. It was a blessing to the world and was thereafter ever
sustained by enlightened ages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172"

knowledge throughout our great Republic, filling every branch of art,
industry, and every profession with men and women of brains and
intelligence.</p>
<p class="par">The force and power of the newspapers in America in
1899, the perfect liberty of <span class="marginnote">Safeguards of
Liberty.</span> the press, were regarded in that year as guarantees of
public safety, mighty levers in forming public opinion. In 1999 the
newspapers of the period had lost none of the prestige and influence
they enjoyed in the old days of sail boats and steam engines. They were
still <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>handled in many instances with consummate skill
and wielded a power that built, as well as shattered, governments.</p>
<p class="par">In current topics and in the chronicles of events, there
existed a marked difference between the newspapers of 1899 and those of
1999. New elements and conditions had come into play which were unknown
in the period of the nineteenth century, and as a natural result the
newspaper of the twentieth century contained some curious and
interesting articles.</p>
<p class="par">In 1899 the daily that got out a morning and evening
edition was regarded as an up to date affair in every sense of the
term, but in 1999 the newspaper world moved much faster. In a large
daily office four complete editions were issued every day or once every
six hours. The news poured into these daily offices with marvelous
speed. Wireless telegraphy and &aelig;rial navigation annihilated
space. On the other hand, newspaper and letter mails in 1999 were
conveyed through much swifter channels.</p>
<p class="par">The postal pneumatic tube system constructed by the
American government was <span class="marginnote">Very Rapid Mail

from Washington, (Mexico), a network of underground and overground
pneumatic tubes reaching throughout the Americas, penetrating all the
Northern, Central and Southern States, from the State of Alaska
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=

"xd21e2150" title="Source: Argentine">Argentina</span>. Mail deliveries
made through these pneumatic tubes were exceedingly rapid. No
electrical transit or any method of &aelig;rial navigation could equal
the rapid delivery of the pneumatic tubes. The mail pouches were forced
through these large tubes and delivered at all the principal cities in
a very short space of time. Mails from Manhattan to Washington, the
seat of the national government in the State of Mexico, traversed the
distance in less than two hours. From Mexico to the State of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2153" title=
"Source: Argentine">Argentina</span>, as well as the Southwestern
American States of Peru and Chile, the mail transit in 1999 required
but a few hours in delivery,&mdash;in 1899 it was a question of weeks.
Even &aelig;rial navigation in 1999 was found too slow to convey and
deliver the mails. The pneumatic tube system was even swifter, and with
such facilities at hand it is not surprising that people in San
Francisco received four daily editions of the Manhattan journals,
although the distance between Sandy Hook and the Golden Gate is a
matter of 3,600 miles.</p>

1999.&mdash;The marine spider, Nautilus, arrived here in bad shape from
Brazil to-day, one of her fore legs having been broken. The Nautilus is
one of the fleet of the South American Importing and Exporting Company,
and was built at Charleston two years ago. The boats in this fleet were
built on the principle of an insect, it being an established fact that
a body can be carried over water much more rapidly than through it. The
spiders were fashioned after the manner of a centipede, the feet being
bell shaped and connected with a superstructural deck by ankle-jointed
pipes, through which, when necessary, a pressure of air could be forced
down upon the enclosed surface of the water. The locomotion is like
that of a pacing horse and great speed can be maintained. The marine
spider had for its inventive source a treatise on its possibilities
written by John Jacob Astor as early as 1894.</p>

<p class="par">It is not to be supposed that farming, the greatest of
all American industries, had not <span class="marginnote">Farm Hands at
a Discount.</span>made any progress during the twentieth century.
Probably in no other field of labor was electricity employed to better
advantage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>Farm hands in the nineteenth century were as
unreliable in some cases as balky horses. The farm owner&rsquo;s
distress and nightmare in 1899 was the farm laborer. But in 1999 the
&ldquo;farm hand&rdquo; was practically done away with. Horses and farm
laborers were no longer employed in the cultivation of the land.
Electricity was on tap in every part of the farm. Even the milking and
stable cleaning was done by mechanical means. In 1899 a farmer who
hired all his work done and lived along comfortably on the proceeds
<span class="marginnote">The Dignity of Labor.</span> of the property,
was called by the absurd title of a &ldquo;gentleman farmer.&rdquo; The
farmer who rolls up his sleeves and toils is none the less a gentleman.
A gentleman is not always the one who spends a life of leisure and
lives on the toil of others. The hard working farmer in many cases
proves to be the real gentleman; he dignifies labor and commands the
respect of his neighbors.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 all agriculturalists were &ldquo;gentleman
farmers.&rdquo; Their great slaves were the electrical machines. They
never groaned, complained or knocked off work in the busy season to go
on an excursion. The electrical farming implements could work all day
without sitting under a shade tree, with a jug of cider and a corn-cob
pipe. They labored patiently and faithfully and performed their tasks
with great accuracy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Some years ago the need of a machine which would
dress persons on arising from bed, make their toilet and prepare them
for breakfast, or a stroll on the street, was generally felt.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Several attempts were made to supply this want, but
nothing was perfected until M. Pantalon announced the completion of his
automatic valet. This machine was shaped very much like an ordinary
man, except that it was built on an absolutely square plan. There were
two upholstered legs, on which reposed a heavy, square chest, and above
the chest was the head, also square and resembling a block.</p>
<div class="div2 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Mechanism of the Valet.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The machinery was directly in the center of the
body-chest, controlling the movement of the legs and arms, the latter
being round, four jointed and twenty-seven inches long. Instead of a
face, the head bore a dial, on which the hour was depicted. The whole
valet was wound up by a small crank in the back. If a man wished to be
aroused, at, let it be said, 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he
adjusted the alarm button on a small dial on the face of the large
clock at that hour.</p>
<p class="par">Promptly at 8 o&rsquo;clock the alarm in the head of the
valet exploded, waking the sleeper. The first movement on the part of
the valet after the alarm had sounded was to move quickly but
noiselessly in the direction of the bath-room, where, by automatic
stoppers, the water is set running, stopping instantly on the tub being
filled.</p>
</div>

<div class="div2 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">An Automatic Bath.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After turning on the water the valet moved back to
the bed, threw the covers aside, and with one of its automatic arms
gently lifted the man from his resting place, conveyed him to the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2423" title=
"Source: bath room">bath-room</span>, laid his night robes aside and
immersed him. The bath completed, the valet drew from its
chest-cupboard two <span class="corr" id="xd21e2426" title=
"Source: flesh-towels">fresh-towels</span>, with which it briskly
rubbed the bather, and then again lifting him up carried him back into
the bedroom, where it proceeded to dress him in clothes which had been
laid in a certain place the night before.</p>
<p class="par">From its automatic chest the valet took comb, brush and
whisk broom, and in less time than would be ordinarily consumed in
telling about it, the toilet was completed. A feature of the invention,
as perfected by Pantalon, was the arrangement on the time dial by which
the speed of the valet could be regulated, and a man could be dressed
quickly or slowly, as he preferred. For busy men, M. Pantalon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>has invented valets that do the business in less
than three minutes, including bath. The chief value of these valets is
that, not being human, they cannot gossip, and every man may become a
hero to his valet, provided the valet is automatic.</p>

<p class="par">In 1999 the mania for saving time and obtaining rapid
results simply knew no bounds. It is a wonder that the inventive genius
of the Yankees was not applied to the perfection of some machine that
would compel the universe to rotate more rapidly upon its axis. So
great was the rush of human affairs that people found little time
<span class="marginnote">Nutritious Pellets for Lunch.</span> to eat.
The feverish, mad rush of the age was intense. No better proof of this
can be found than in the success of a peculiar enterprise, which in
1899 would have proved a flat failure. In the good old days of 1899
people at least took time to eat, but in 1999 a big company was
capitalized to manufacture and sell Ready Digested Dinners. In order to
save time, people often dined on a pill,&mdash;a small pellet which
contained highly nutritious food. They had little inclination to
stretch their legs under a table for an hour at a time while
masticating an eight-course dinner.</p>

<p class="par first">The art of Color-photography perfected in 1920.
The world&rsquo;s great artists witness the death-knell of art. The
doom of cheap chromos. Nature paints her own matchless pictures. The
sculptor&rsquo;s art remains supreme in 1999. No machine can ever
chisel a Venus de Milo. No substitute found for the human voice.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Painting, in 1999, had become a lost art, doomed,
alas, never to revive. The glorious canvases of the old masters were
still highly treasured. There still existed artists who threw their
entire souls into beautiful paintings, superb creations of their
artistic minds, true in every detail to nature. Although painting as a
high art still existed in 1999, yet, as a profession and a means of
obtaining a livelihood, it died very much after the manner of wood
engraving, when the half tone process was perfected and had come into
general use.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1912, after many struggles and
disappointments, Prof. Deweyton, of the Montpelier, (Vt.) University,
perfected the process of color-photography. This coveted secret, at
last, had been wrested from nature. For centuries her beauties had been
admired but never had she consented to transfer her own original colors
on photographic plates and canvas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When the art of color photography was perfected, the
world then had little use for <span class="marginnote">The Passing of
the Artist.</span> easels, palettes and painters. Nature became the
Artist of the world and none dared to dispute her sway. At first it was
with a feeling of sadness that the world parted with the art profession
and its devotees, men and women who had imparted to canvas the
world&rsquo;s historic scenes, the portraits of the world&rsquo;s great
men, enchanting, noble women. The works of these great artists had
delighted the children of men for many centuries. Raphael, Titian,
Michael Angelo, Correggio, Guido, and other famous artists, had
bequeathed their glorious treasures of art to a grateful world, and
even color photographic pictures done by nature&rsquo;s own hand cannot
rob these eminent artists of an iota of their fame. It was sad to think
that after the discovery of color-photography great artists would lose
their prestige, for none can rival nature in her own art.</p>
<p class="par">This new process of Nature painting rendered to the
world an invaluable service by <span class="marginnote">The Chromo
Affliction Subsides.</span> driving out of the market a flood of cheap
pictures and chromos of the most inferior class; pictures that had
crept into many homes simply because they were cheap. These
afflictions, too often paraded with flash moulding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>on
the walls of our homes, were driven out by color-photography. In 1950
the old-style chromos were rare; they quickly disappeared from the
habitations of men.</p>
<p class="par">Through the specially constructed cameras of Prof.
Deweyton, life size pictures <span class="marginnote">Glorious Sunset
Views.</span> were secured, large landscape scenes, magnificent marine
views, were reproduced with the exact colors of nature. Superb sunset
views, in a matchless wealth of color, a revelry of gold and crimson,
were transferred to canvas by natural process in 1920. This process
became the great art triumph of the twentieth century. No human hand
had ever attempted with any hope of success to reproduce on canvas the
bewitching and mystic effects of the gloaming. Nature with her master
hand, dared to reproduce, on canvas, this most difficult of all
artistic studies. Michael Angelo, the supreme chief of all living or
dead artists, never attempted to reproduce on canvas Vesuvius in active
eruption. No human power could do the faintest justice to such a scene
and no master of the art ever cared to risk his reputation in the
attempt. But in color-photographs Nature reproduced the exact colors of
the seething flames as they belched forth from the quivering crater. In
1930 a magnificent picture of Vesuvius, &AElig;tna or Stramboli in
active eruption could be purchased for the pitiable sum of $50. So
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>perfectly natural were the volcanic flames that
the effect was startling. The lava <span class="marginnote">Could
Almost Smell the Sulphur.</span> running down the mountain side
apparently threatened to set fire to the very walls of the room. A
picture of this kind, a feeble representation painted by some eminent
artist, would cost over $10,000.</p>
<p class="par">The process of color-photography proved invaluable in
reproducing human features and expression. Nothing could exceed the
perfection the art attained in 1935. Photographic studios were crowded
with work. No skill of man had ever transferred to canvas the
maiden&rsquo;s blush, that emblem of purity, a shade Divine which
mantles the brow of innocence only. The cameras of 1935 proved equal to
that delicate task. The maid caught blushing in color photography
blushed on, alas, forever. In detecting criminals, the new art proved
invaluable. The Rogues&rsquo; Gallery was soon filled with studies in
life and deviltry, so natural that one&rsquo;s first impulse was to
reach out for a pair of handcuffs.</p>
<p class="par">Although painting, in 1999, and long before that date,
had received a severe blow, the sculptor&rsquo;s art remained
unchanged. The sculptor was still supreme in his domain. No machine had
yet been found that could take a block of pure Parian marble and carve
out a Venus de Milo. Nature had invaded the artist&rsquo;s studio and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>robbed him of an honored profession, but nature,
great and mighty as she certainly is, had not yet, in 1999, found a way
to fashion a block of cold marble into a thing of beauty, an exact
image of life. Statuary was still regarded in the twentieth century as
the acme of true art. The sculptor had not yet been dethroned; it is
doubtful if he ever will be. The new and most ingenious machines of the
twentieth century met their Manila on statuary. No machine can ever
<span class="marginnote">Limits to Inventive Genius.</span> be built
that will reason or think. It requires thought, judgment and artistic
taste to create a statue. As the artist beholds a perfect model, he
becomes thrilled with the love of his art. His heart and hands are
guided by fires of ambition and his work excites admiration. The human
brain is often duplicated by machinery, but the equal of the human
heart, with its subtle emotions, must ever remain a Sealed Book to
cold, unfeeling mechanism.</p>
<p class="par">The same might be said of the human voice. In 1999, that
peerless gift of God to man, that wonderful channel through which all
emotions are expressed, had not been uprooted by mechanism. The Pattis,
Nordicas and Melbas of the twentieth century were still held in high
esteem, commanding princely stipends. The domain of all mechanical
music, however, had been invaded to a large extent. Pianos, organs,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>orchestral and metallic instruments, which had
attained a high degree of perfection in the nineteenth century, were
generally discarded in the twentieth century. The tendency of the age
favored mechanical music. The automatic musical instruments, which in
1889 had already attained a certain degree of perfection, were greatly
improved. In the navy cornet bands were discarded and were substituted
by large musical machines that played operas, marches, quicksteps,
waltzes and patriotic airs with wonderful accuracy, with a volume of
sound surpassing the best efforts of efficient brass bands. In the
army, the brass band always held its own. The men who composed the band
could march and fight, while no automatic substitute could be made to
do this. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The changes in our social system that signalized
the period of 1999 were marked and contrasted very favorably with the
conditions extant in 1899.</p>
<p class="par">Street noises that rendered city and often village life
unendurable, in 1899 were entirely <span class="marginnote">Uproar of
Vehicles<a id="xd21e2515" name="xd21e2515"></a> Abolished.</span>
abolished in 1999. The clattering of horses&rsquo; hoofs became unknown
in city life. Milk wagons, enormous furniture vans, the brewery wagon
with its pyramid of beer kegs, rattling express carts, mail delivery
wagons and thundering omnibuses no longer tortured the human ear in
1999. Automobiles had sent the clattering hoofs to Tophet and
electricity, with pneumatic tires, was exclusively used in
transportation.</p>
<p class="par">It was a curious sight in 1999 to observe the life and
animation of rapidly moving, yet noiseless, vehicles in city streets.
Shouting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>whistling and all loud noises were strictly
prohibited on all public avenues. The jingling of bells, the yells of
street Arabs, the thunder of wagon wheels over pavements and the
pandemonium that reigned on all streets in 1899 became memories of a
strange past.</p>
<p class="par">The black pall of smoke that hovered over manufacturing
cities and darkened the <span class="marginnote">Havanas Cent
Apiece.</span> lives of all men, had disappeared. Electricity drove
smoke back into Hades and kept it there. Manhattan, (formerly New York)
the largest and grandest city in the world in 1999, was no longer
troubled in this manner. The only smoke that was ever seen in city or
country life curled up from Havana cigars, of the best grades raised on
American plantations in Cuba and retailed in Manhattan for one cent
apiece. Pipes were occasionally used but had lost much of their former
popularity. Workmen and the poorest classes could enjoy a fragrant
Havana for one cent and pipes were no longer used on the mere pretence
of economy.</p>
<p class="par">In the 20th century the tobacco chewer&rsquo;s life was
not an enjoyable one. In many States of the Americas, in 1999, notably
Brazil, East Canada and Argentina, it became a penal offense to chew
tobacco in public. In 1999 tobacco chewing was everywhere regarded in
the United States of the Americas in the same light as opium
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>smoking. It was considered a filthy practice,
one that must not be tolerated in public. It was regarded as a danger
to public health for men to spit chewing tobacco on the street walks.
Ladies in 1999 made up their minds that they had got through stepping
on tobacco quids on the streets. Indeed, spitting had been prohibited
in all public places. The habit was filthy and dangerous, causing the
spread of disease germs. In 1980 it frequently happened that the city
police raided chewing tobacco joints and hauled the offenders before
court for fine.</p>
<p class="par">But, perhaps the worst form of smoking was the
diabolical cigarette. In 1899 it <span class="marginnote">Arrested for
Smoking Cigarettes.</span> was already sapping the youth of America,
filling our hospitals with the sick and our State asylums with
imbeciles. Great fears were already entertained in 1899 as to the
outcome, but public opinion did not realize the danger to the national
safety until 1912. In 1921 Congress passed a law making the sale,
importation or manufacture of cigarettes a felony. Every inducement was
extended by National and State Legislatures to encourage the growth of
the purest Havana and Manila tobaccos. The object was to place a good,
harmless cigar within the reach of everyone and to discourage the
chewing and cigarette practices.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 moderation in the use of wines <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>and
beverages became almost universal. Even in the State of Mexico and
other tropical States of the Americas, drunkenness became almost
unknown. In fact, it was regarded as a deep disgrace and a penal
offense to be caught drunk in public. A drunken man was regarded in
1999 as a moral leper and was isolated from his fellow creatures for a
period of one year and forever after was debarred from holding any
public office. The law was sternly administered in every case which
carried conviction.</p>
<p class="par">The vicious laws of 1899 which allowed the government to
collect an enormous <span class="marginnote">Drunkenness Very
Rare.</span> revenue on spirituous liquors and permitted manufacturers
to poison their victims with noxious liquids were greatly ameliorated.
The National government took up the work of purification in the matter
of manufacturing all liquors. A much purer and safer article, much less
liable to injure one&rsquo;s health and to intoxicate, was placed on
the market. It was recognized that the government could not regulate
the appetites of people, but it determined to regulate the purity of
the liquors they drank. This wise course produced a decided change for
the better. Drunkenness was reduced to a minimum and homes were made
happier. Although men still &ldquo;drank&rdquo; in 1999, none but an
abject sot ever lost his mental balance and disturbed public peace.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1999 vast strides of progress had been made in
medicine and surgery, and disease had been eliminated to a very large
extent from our social system. Science attained a complete mastery over
the hitherto unknown <span class="marginnote">Triumph of Mind Over
Matter.</span> field of organisms. Man&rsquo;s mastery over these
agents marked the greatest stride ever made in the conquest of mind
over matter. All classes of bacteria were held under perfect control.
In 1999 contagious and infectious diseases occurred only in sporadic
form. The chief ills of life were those attendant upon old age.</p>
<p class="par">Specific organisms, namely those of construction and
destruction, were created at will in that year, and were made to work
with certain and perfect results. In this manner disease was easily
combated.</p>
<p class="par">Fire departments in the city lost much of their old-time
importance. In 1999 only ten fire stations were required in the great
metropolis of Manhattan. In 1899 the population of New York was
3,500,000 and the number of its brave firemen ran up in the ten
thousands. In 1999 the population of Manhattan was nearly 25,000,000
souls, and its fire department required only three thousand firemen to
operate it. The reason for this is very simple. In 1899 fire was used
everywhere; while in 1999 very few houses had any use for that element.
Electricity had completely abolished fire as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>domestic agent or motive power. In 1999 people
never ceased to marvel how their predecessors got along with so much
fire, in one form or other, burning in their houses.</p>
<p class="par">The sufferings of the poor in crowded city tenements
during the fierce heats of summer, with a coal stove in their room,
<span class="marginnote">Very Little Fire Used.</span> were recalled.
The frightful heat took away all energy and appetite. Then the burning
kerosene lamps were called to mind. Furnaces with roaring fires of
coal, wood and oil, gas jets, matches, all helped to increase the
percentage of danger. Fire departments were in great demand in the good
old days of 1899, and insurance companies amassed fortunes by the side
of which Monte Cristo was a mere Lazarus.</p>
<p class="par">In those days fire not only constantly threatened the
destruction of property, but many thousands of valuable lives were
destroyed every year by that element. In 1899 women still clung to
their long, dangerous and unhealthy skirts, long dresses that impeded
their movements and exposed them to constant danger from fire. Fearful
tales on land and sea were told of horrible sacrifices by fire. In 1999
all this was banished, never to return. Fires were extinguished
everywhere. A safer and better element had taken its place. The
Pharsees of India were, perhaps, the only people in 1999 who still
&ldquo;worshipped&rdquo; fire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Theatres in 1999 were extensively patronized, but so
rigid were the laws against immoral displays that none ventured to
violate. The cause of morality generally had made strides of progress
in the 20th century. The world grew brighter and better and became more
humane. Vice and immorality were suppressed, not so much by operation
and fear of the law but by Christianizing methods. As the world grew
older it became more manifest that crime and immorality must make way
for purity and honesty. Theatrical performances in 1999 were more
chaste, more attractive and entertaining. The exhibitions of nudity, so
<span class="marginnote">No Seeley Dinners in 1999.</span> common in
1899, became unknown to the stage in 1999. Electricity was very
successfully employed in all scenic stage effects. Some spectacular
performances were beautiful visions of fairyland. Public entertainments
carefully suppressed all that appealed to the baser passions. In 1899
our churches and theatres were still apart, but in 1999 so marked was
the purity of the stage and so lofty its ideals, that church members
were not afraid to acknowledge that they attended the theatres.</p>
<p class="par">Churches, on the other hand, became more Christianized
in 1999. The envy, wrath and jealousy which existed between the
denominations and religions lost much of their acrimony in the 20th
century. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>hatred and contempt that the Mohammedan
<span class="marginnote">An Era of Fraternal Love.</span> entertained
for the Christian, had greatly softened. The Roman Catholic, the Greek
and Protestant Churches, followers of the same Saviour, regarded each
other with more fraternal feelings and became more tolerant. As
education became more generally diffused, humanity broadened the heart.
Children in 1999 could not comprehend the infamy of a nation that could
perpetrate the horrors of the Inquisition under a pretext of serving
the cause of a gentle Christ. Their minds could not understand how in
the 17th century both Protestants and Catholics burned, pillaged and
destroyed one another&rsquo;s property; burned men, women and children
at the stake and committed nameless horrors, all under a <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2578" title="Source: sacriligious">sacrilegious</span>
pretext of serving a Divine Master. These persecutions and the
unfriendly feelings between opposing religions almost disappeared
toward the close of the 20th century. The acrimony of the past was
buried to a very large extent.</p>
<p class="par">In 1899 the leading religions of the world, in point of
numbers, were Buddhism, and the followers of Confucius, who in that
year numbered 485,000,000 followers. Next in force of numbers at the
close of the nineteenth century ranked the Christians, who numbered
454,729,151. The Mohammedans numbered in 1899 about 170,000,000,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>Brahmanists 139,000,000, and Pagans or Heathens
220,000,000.</p>
<p class="par">Christians were by far the most enlightened, most
powerful and progressive religious <span class=
"marginnote">Christianity the Light of the World.</span> element at the
close of the nineteenth century and were firm believers in the cause of
education. Through their influence in the twentieth century education
became widely diffused. Turkey felt the force of the movement, and the
dense ignorance of its population became more enlightened and less
cruel. In 1999 the Christians of Armenia were no longer held in
bondage. The horrible massacres of 1894 which so deeply stirred the
hearts of all nations were memories of the past. The Sublime Porte had
ordered that education be made compulsory between the ages of ten and
fifteen years. Through English influence the cause of education was
also generally diffused throughout Africa. Where education gained a
foothold superstition was uprooted.</p>
<p class="par">Christianity made rapid advance in the world in 1999,
and Christians outnumbered all other religious beliefs. The sublime
gospel of the Cross dominated the human family in that year, inspiring
more love and gentleness among men. The vital force of Christianity,
perhaps little understood in the nineteenth century, became a mighty
lever for good in the following century. At the close of the twentieth
century indications <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>pointed to a general christianizing of all
peoples of the globe. The three leading powers of the world, the United
States of the Americas, Great Britain and Russia, and in fact the whole
of Europe, except Spain, which country was obliterated in 1930, as
already described, exerted a mighty moral force upon the other nations.
Even Japan was rapidly coming under the banner of the Cross.</p>
<p class="par">In 1940 the ancient city of Jerusalem was delivered over
into the keeping of a Christian power. All the territory about that
ancient city, including the seaport of Jaffa, Bethlehem, the Mt. of
Olives, and other localities made sacred by the Mantle of our glorious
Saviour while on earth, were transferred by the Ottoman government into
the safe keeping of the German people.</p>
<p class="par">The Jews never returned to Jerusalem to rule again in
that city. Centuries of persecution had driven them into every corner
of the globe and under the protection of every flag. They had no use
for Jerusalem in the twentieth century and nothing was farther from
their minds than the re-establishment of the Jewish hierarchy. Their
business had long been established all over the world and under no
consideration could they be induced to return to the land of their
forefathers, merely on a point of sentiment. Should the Messiah ever
again return to earth, they argued, it mattered little whether they
were huddled together in Jerusalem or scattered over the globe.

<h2 class="main"><span class="sc">Arbitration.</span></h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">It was not a complete but only a partial success.
Certain international questions cannot be adjusted by arbitration. The
losses of the American Civil War. Europe&rsquo;s terrible war record
during the nineteenth century. The Great American Republic in 1999 has
no use for arbitration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the twentieth century many bloody wars were
averted by the peaceful offices of arbitration. The Great Dream of
Universal peace, however, had not been fully realized in 1999. In the
political life of all nations controversies arise that cannot be left
for adjudication to arbitration. Were it not so all disputations might
be entrusted to the decision of the arbiter and the world would gain
immensely by the abolition of the savage methods of war. A majority of
the disputes between nations can be settled by arbitration, but not
all. No tribunal of arbitration could have decided the issue in 1898
between America and Spain. It was a question of tyranny. Spain was
determined <span class="marginnote">Questions That Cannot Be
Arbitrated.</span> to maintain a hell at our very doors in Cuba. That
nation could not conquer Cuba and had proved, after over four hundred
years, her utter inability to govern that island. In the face of wanton
persecution, tyranny and merciless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>outrage perpetrated by Spain,
would America have been justified in leaving its contention to
arbitration? Certainly not.</p>
<p class="par">When, in 1870, Count Beneditti, openly insulted the King
of Prussia at Ems and aroused the indignation of all German subjects,
what could Prussia do, leave the matter to arbitration? Impossible.
After Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba and returned to France
in 1815, ought the other nations of Europe which he had overrun with
fire and sword, to have consented to arbitration as a means of quieting
Europe? Certainly not. When in 1860 the Southern States of America
seceded from the Union, declared their right of self government and
privilege of perpetuating slavery, what tribunal of arbitration could
have decided the issue between the North and South? None.</p>
<p class="par">Human passions and ambitions did not change in the
twentieth century. International <span class="marginnote">It Commanded
Universal Respect.</span> quarrels arose in the nineteenth century
which could not be submitted to arbitration and war became the final
resort. At the same time the world&rsquo;s call for arbitration, and
the efforts made to enthrone Peace instead of War, never ceased to
occupy the minds of twentieth century statesmen. The history of the
world for centuries had been written in blood. The enormous standing
armies of Europe were fast sapping the vitality and energy of those
nations. Something <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span>had to be done to avert catastrophe and
financial ruin and the Czar&rsquo;s call for a Peace Congress at the
Hague, justly commanded the respect of the world.</p>
<p class="par">War is a dreadful stain upon humanity. It is cruel,
barbarous. The twentieth century was not equal to the task of entirely
substituting peace for war, but made great progress in that
direction.</p>
<p class="par">In the nineteenth century the North spent $4,800,000,000
during the American <span class="marginnote">Cost of the American Civil
War.</span> Civil War, and the South spent $2,300,000,000. The number
of casualties in the volunteer and regular armies of the United States
during this war were as follows: Killed in battle, 67,056; died of
wounds, 43,012; died of disease, 199,720; died from other causes,
40,154; total number of deaths, 349,944. The number of soldiers in the
Confederate service, who died of wounds or disease, was about
133,800.</p>
<p class="par">The world&rsquo;s plea for arbitration in the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries was indeed a forceful one and the Peace
Conference at the Hague in 1899 deserved absolute success. It has been
estimated that 40,000,000 human beings perish in war every century.
Since the Trojan war (about 3,000 years ago), it is estimated that
1,000,200,000 men have perished (up to the close of the nineteenth
century) in battle. The population of the world in 1899 was placed at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>1,500,000,000. If all who had been killed in
battle since the Trojan war could be ranged on a field and the entire
population of the world also enumerated, the numbers of the killed
would nearly equal those of the living.</p>
<p class="par">In the 19th century in no direction was so much human
energy wasted as in preparation for war or in the process of actual
warfare. It was stupendous folly and a crime, a blot upon civilization.
With such terrible figures before them the advocates of universal peace
might well take heart at the sight of a Peace Conference, gathered in
1899 to adopt measures to reduce European armaments. During the last
half of the 19th century the following great wars were waged:</p>

<p class="par">These figures are frightful but they represent only a
fraction of the losses of life and treasure through war, during the
last half of the 19th century. The above figures do not include scores
of other wars that occurred during that period. The Chino-Japanese war
did not reduce the population of the Celestials to any appreciable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>extent but in loss of treasure it proved a
costly struggle. The war between Spain <span class="marginnote">A Story
only Half Told.</span> and America, commencing April 21st, and ending
October 26, 1898, must also be reckoned in this list. The ceaseless
tribal wars of Asia and Africa, also the French colonial wars in
Madagascar, Tonquin, Siam, and the endless struggles between savage
races of Borneo, Sumatra, the Zulus and head-hunters of the Philippine
islands must all be included in the list of mortality from warfare
during the last half of the 19th century.</p>
<p class="par">The plea for arbitration and the cessation of war was a
noble effort and a just tribute to the civilization of the closing days
of the nineteenth century. America lent her voice in the cause of Peace
at the Hague Conference. In the interests of humanity this was the
proper course to follow. America at this conference represented
75,000,000 of the most intelligent, brave and industrious people on
earth, whose army was a mere corporal&rsquo;s guard.</p>
<p class="par">In the twentieth century, however, the great United
States of the Americas, with <span class="marginnote">America a law
Unto Herself.</span> its magnificent sweep of territory extending from
Alaska to Patagonia, and its national capital built on the site of the
city of Mexico, had little use for arbitration. In 1999 the vast
American Republic had <span class="corr" id="xd21e2722" title=
"Source: beome">become</span> a world in itself. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>It
had long passed the period when it had become necessary to consult
other nations on international questions and abide by their wishes.
America in 1999 was a law unto herself, and had very little use for
arbitration in the disposition of her international affairs.</p>
<p class="par">Arbitration answers very well providing that the
arbiters are just and impartial and prove themselves able to arrive at
a decision in perfect justice and equity. But America in the twentieth
century, on account of her enormous expansion and world-wide commerce,
had excited the jealousy as well as cupidity of every other civilized
nation, with the one exception of Great Britain. In any court of
international arbitration in which America might appear either as a
plaintiff or as a defendant, the chances were largely in favor of a
decision being rendered against her.</p>
<p class="par">America was denied justice in these international courts
of arbitration. Left to the <span class="marginnote">Europe Becomes
Jealous of America.</span> decision of European arbiters her case was
invariably lost. Even in 1898 Europe&rsquo;s jealousy was
ill-concealed. Germany and France would have been glad indeed to have
assisted Spain in taming the Yankee and the rest of Europe, England
excepted, would have applauded their interference. Because of
England&rsquo;s firm stand Germany and France decided that prudence was
the better part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208"
name="pb208">208</a>]</span>of valor, and those two nations declined to
have their navies blown out of salt water by the combined navies of
England and America.</p>
<p class="par">If, as above evidenced, Europe regarded America in 1898
with feelings of envy and malice, imagine then the European condition
of mind towards the great American Republic in 1999 when it contained a
population of over 500,000,000 citizens, inclusive of a territory that
represented nearly one-fourth of the habitable globe.</p>
<p class="par">European nations in the twentieth century (always
excepting Great Britain) would have been very glad, at any time, to
attack and humble America, but so great was the power of our noble
Republic in that era that even the combined assaults of the world could
not have accomplished this feat.</p>
<p class="par">As a natural consequence of this unfriendly feeling on
the part of Europe, which grew in strength as time rolled on, America
in the twentieth century withdrew from the International Court of
Arbitration. America became big enough, strong and willing enough to
take care of herself. In other words, throughout the twentieth century,
Uncle Sam ran his own ranch and had things pretty much his own way.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Kissing as a fine art was on the wane in the
twentieth century. In the nineteenth century the Japanese had long
banished that custom as one dangerous to health and as a medium for
communicating infectious diseases. In that remarkable and highly
progressive country no kisses, or salutation with the lips, are
exchanged between husband and wife, parent and son, brother and
sister.</p>
<p class="par">The custom, without doubt, is an unwholesome one, yet
one in vogue for so <span class="marginnote">Kissing Strictly
Prohibited.</span> many centuries, even in the days of the Romans, that
it became a second nature. In the nineteenth century one might as well
attempt to scale Mt. <span class="corr" id="xd21e2759" title=
"Source: Renier">Rainier</span> with a ladder as to endeavor to
convince the mother of a new born babe that kissing is a dangerous
habit. The lover in his rapturous mode expresses in a kiss the acme of
his devotion. It seems cruel to destroy idols before whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>we
have bowed down and offered incense during a whole lifetime. Custom,
tradition and education are hard task-masters. They cling to us through
life like limpets to a rock.</p>
<p class="par">Kissing, however, never came under ban of the law in the
twentieth century, but the practice was discontinued on purely hygienic
grounds. The mode of salutation in 1999 that was regarded as being the
most tender expression of love, consisted of a gentle patting of the
cheek. The advanced reason of the age broke the barriers of custom in
this case; lips were seldom allowed to touch lips. A pressure of the
hand became ample compensation for the most ardent lovers, while the
matchless language of the eyes left no room for doubt in a
lover&rsquo;s breast that his love was reciprocated.</p>
<p class="par">In the twentieth century men began to acknowledge the
absolute folly of the <span class="marginnote">The Cursing
Habit.</span> cursing habit. If any excuse could ever be offered in
palliation of this vicious habit it might be made in the case of a man
whose mind was disturbed by angry passions. In an outburst of passion a
slight pretext might be offered for the vigorous use of unwritten
Anglo-Saxon. But the twentieth century very properly turned its face
against the practice of verbal profanation. This reprehensible habit
was made punishable, in every instance, by a heavy fine and
imprisonment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the nineteenth century laws against profanity already
existed, but they were a dead-letter on all of our statute books. In
those days men might quarrel in public or in private; they might hurl
epithets at one another by the hour or by the day, so long as neither
one of the belligerents raised a hand against the other, society and
law took no cognizance of the unhappy occurrence. Men might exchange
the vilest expressions and fill the air with their <span class="corr"
id="xd21e2774" title="Source: suphurious">sulphurous</span>
maledictions; they might insult the public ear with a riot of
profanation, no breach of the peace occurred in the eye of the law
until blows were given or exchanged.</p>
<p class="par">In the twentieth century it was finally discovered that
the tongue was often a more offensive disturber of the peace than a
blow of the fist. It was then recognized that vile expressions,
particularly those which attacked innocent members of a family, were
more cruel and cutting than blows delivered by hand or weapon. Society
and law in the twentieth century determined to uproot and severely
punish the offending of a vile tongue.</p>
<p class="par">Wife-beaters in 1999 were speedily brought to time.
These degraded specimens of humanity finally received their just dues
on conviction. The lash which the State of Delaware wields to such
excellent advantage in many criminal cases was generally regarded as
inadequate punishment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>for such brutes. It was felt that
wife-beaters should be made conspicuous examples before the
community.</p>
<p class="par">Every town in the Americas, from Alaska to Patagonia,
was provided with a large <span class="marginnote">Punishment of Wife
Beaters.</span> derrick, erected upon a solid stone foundation on the
edge of some body of water. On the day and hour appointed for the
execution of the sentence, the culprit was taken from the town jail or
lock-up by the sheriff of the county. A large concourse of citizens
usually gathered in the locality of the derrick to witness the
&ldquo;water cure<span class="corr" id="xd21e2788" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo; Arriving there, the sheriff adjusted
two belts around the prisoner, one under his arms and the <span class=
"marginnote">A First-class Water Cure.</span> other about his loins.
The belts were connected by a broad strap over the back, in the center
of which was firmly fastened a large hook. This hook was fastened to
the chain or rope of the derrick. Upon a given signal the prisoner was
hoisted to the top of the arm of the derrick, which was then swung over
the sheet of water. The windlass of the derrick was let loose and the
prisoner plunged, usually a distance of twenty feet, into the water. He
was then hoisted up again, and the dose repeated three more times. When
the punishment was over the prisoner was properly cared for by the
sheriff and his poss&eacute;. He was conveyed in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>some
vehicle back to the jail, where his ducking suit was removed.
Attendants were on hand, who rubbed him dry and helped him put on his
own clothes. He was then given refreshment and a cup of strong coffee
and admonished to go forth and do better.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In the by-gone days of the eighteenth century,
highwaymen, Dick Turpins, Jack <span class="marginnote">Highwaymen and
Pirates.</span> Shepherds and the robber element, held high carnival,
flourishing in their plenitude and zenith. The old stage coach days
greatly favored the success of their profession. The appearance of
steam ruined their avocation. The same fate befell the pirates of the
high seas, marine highwaymen who thrived and carried on their nefarious
trade in the days of sailing ships. When steam came into general use it
became impossible for them to ply their trade. A steam pirate ship
could not very well carry on operations. Frequent coaling and repairs
to machinery soon revealed their identity.</p>
<p class="par">The highwayman and his confr&egrave;re, the pirate, were
children of the 18th century. The conditions of that period favored
their existence. They who would pursue the highwayman must have the
swifter horse, otherwise pursuit became futile. The sailing man-of-war
that would overtake the pirate must have a swifter keel or lose the
race. But when came the days of steam <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>these marauders by
land and sea were driven from their lairs.</p>
<p class="par">These were products of the 18th century, but it was in
the 19th century that the tramp, a degenerate son of the bold thieves
above mentioned, first saw the light <span class="marginnote">The Great
American Tramp.</span> of day. The tramp of the 19th century, (an
exclusive exotic of that era,) was a compound mixture of loafer and
robber. He led a life of leisure. The law of that period rather
encouraged his existence than otherwise. After roaming over the country
during the open summer weather, as the first flakes of snow fell, the
tramp, with the utmost ease, contrived to secure a six months&rsquo;
sentence in some county jail. Once safely <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2816" title="Source: ensconsed">ensconced</span> under the
sheriff&rsquo;s wing for the winter months, he congratulated himself as
a most favored <span class="marginnote">A Tramp&rsquo;s Paradise in
1899.</span> mortal. He was sure, above all things, of not having any
work to do. That supreme misfortune having been averted, the tramp was
at peace with the world. Work and soap were his deadly enemies; could
the jail save him from these, come what might, his serenity of mind
remained undisturbed. He had a warm bed, three regular warm meals
daily, with the privilege of playing cards, smoking and reading as
suited best his fancy. What better could any tramp ask for? The county
jail was to him a haven of rest,&mdash;a paradise. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This delightful condition of affairs, however, rapidly
changed in the 20th century. Society grew tired of turning county jails
into tramp colleges, from which, after a very pleasant winter&rsquo;s
rest, the tramp graduated in the spring and was again let loose upon
the community. Tramps were compelled to work or starve in our county
jails long before 1910. They were given plenty of stone to crush under
suitable sheds, and the product of their labor contributed to better
roads. After a few years, the new law had its effect. The tramp rapidly
disappeared and monuments of stone were raised in every county jail to
the memory of an extinct species.</p>
<p class="par">The twentieth century method of exchanging salutations
in public places was in marked contrast with the custom that obtained
in the nineteenth century. During the latter period on meeting friends
or acquaintances in public places, it was a custom established from
time immemorial, when ladies and gentlemen met, for the gentleman to
uncover by raising his hat. <span class="marginnote">New Style of
Salutation.</span> This was a graceful as well as a distinct act of
courtesy. The lady, however, in nine cases out of ten, acknowledged the
salutation, by merely looking in the direction of the one who had just
saluted her. The lady occasionally added a smile in cases that were
warranted by ties of friendship. These <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>courtesies were
graceful but in the twentieth century the ladies were the first to
acknowledge that their method of salutation was ambiguous and
indefinite. It was not as pronounced and distinctive as the salutation
accorded them by the sterner sex. Suspicion crept into the public mind
that there was room for improvement in the exchange of salutation on
both sides.</p>
<p class="par">About the period of 1925 a radical change was effected.
Upon meeting in public places, it was no longer customary for the
gentleman to uncover, or for the lady to cast a glance in <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2834" title=
"Source: acknowledgement">acknowledgment</span> of his salutation. The
mode was simplified. Ladies and gentlemen saluted one another in
precisely the same manner. Each one, upon approach, raised their right
hand in military salute, touching the hat, and by a quick movement,
letting the hand drop to the side. This new custom placed both sexes
upon equal and exact terms.</p>
<p class="par">Whenever, in the twentieth century, a gentleman
addressed a lady, after the usual military salutation, it was his duty
to uncover and hold his hat in his right hand, regardless of the
weather. Failure to do this would result in non-recognition on the part
of the lady. The respect due to the fair sex perceptibly increased in
the twentieth century and so must it ever increase as the world&rsquo;s
civilization advances.</p>
<p class="par">Man may be classed as being a carniverous animal.
Vegetarians hold a different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=
"#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>theory. They banish from their
tables the flesh of beasts or birds that have been killed, eschewing
meats of all kinds. It is the privilege of the vegetarian to live up to
the dietary standard which he has adopted. Two-thirds of the human
family take issue with the vegetarian on this subject. The vast
majority are in favor of meats of all kinds as an article of food. In
the nineteenth, and, in fact, in all the preceding centuries, the
delicacies of the table most highly esteemed were those in which rare
viands of every variety were included.</p>
<p class="par">A model nineteenth century table reveled in such dishes
as <span lang="fr">turbot &agrave; la cardinal</span>, mutton
<span class="marginnote">A Standard of Food.</span> chops, pork
cutlets, lamb, spring chicken, selle-de mouton, ham, tongue, roast
partridge, roast duck with sage dressing, turkey and cranberry sauce,
braized mutton, deviled crabs, meat fritters, sausage, cold boiled ham.
These savory meat dishes invariably played leading r&ocirc;les at the
tables of rich and poor. Vegetables and desserts were regarded as
adjuncts to the feast.</p>
<p class="par">Vegetarians regard such food as alien to the human
system and unnecessary to its sustenance. Added to this the vegetarians
entertain a sentimental view of the meat-food question. They claim that
man has no right to kill beast, fish, bird or fowl, to secure food
supplies, and that all flesh food should be eliminated from the human
system. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>A vegetarian&rsquo;s table was garnished with
delightful dishes, such as sliced oranges, buttered toast, baked
quinces, quaking omelet, shredded wheat biscuits, dates with quaker
oats, fried hominy, stewed prunes, macaroni and cheese, stewed fig with
whipped cream, French-fried potatoes, oyster plant and rice muffins.
These dishes are clean and wholesome, although decidedly tame from
certain points of view.</p>
<p class="par">Vegetarians in 1999 were more emphatic in their views
than their brethren of 1899. <span class="marginnote">Vegetarians
Refuse to Wear Shoes.</span> They still enjoyed peanut sandwiches,
fried egg-plant steak, health crackers, nut biscuits, spiced beans and
other delicacies dear to the hearts of those who have foresworn eating
the flesh of &ldquo;suffering, sentient things.&rdquo; In 1999
vegetarians refused to wear leather shoes. It came hard at first but
shoes had to be sacrificed to principle. They refused to eat meat
because it necessitated the killing of beast or fowl. On this account
also they refused to wear shoes of leather because the beef must be
killed in order to procure the leather. For the same reason vegetarians
in 1999 refused to wear silk of any kind because its manufacture cost
the lives of the dear little worms. They also refused, for the same
reason, to carry alligator skin pocket books. It was so wrong to kill
the poor alligators. Vegetarians claim that flesh is from ten to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>twenty times more expensive than fruits or
cereals, and that it is unphilosophical and unbusinesslike to pay the
larger sum for inferior food. Neither justice nor benevolence can
sanction the revolting cruelties that are daily perpetrated in order to
pamper perverted and unnatural appetites. Vegetarians in 1999 were
horrified at the practices of the nineteenth century, when butchers
would take innocent little lambs, the most harmless and pitiful
creatures, and cut their throats in the slaughter house. The seas of
blood that flowed through Chicago slaughter pens had no attractions for
vegetarians.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 the world was by no means converted to any
single theory or idea on the food question. A delicious cold ham
sandwich or slice of turkey with truffles still delighted the palates
of millions in that year. The savory hot bird, washed down with a cold
bottle, still held captive many epicureans in the closing days of the
twentieth century. The birds of the air and beasts of the field still
contributed to the world&rsquo;s gastronomic pleasures. In 1999 the
vegetarian remained faithful to his creed. Plum pudding, peaches in
wine, haricots vert, and other delicacies held the place of honor at
their tables.</p>
<p class="par">But in 1999 the world became more liberal in its views
on the meat-food question. In the nineteenth century no argument could
shake the prejudice existing against <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>the consumption of
horseflesh. Anyone in 1899 who could champion the use of <span class=
"marginnote">The Prejudice against Horseflesh.</span> horseflesh and
advocate its sale in open market on the same counter as hogs and
poultry, would be regarded in the light of a barbarian or a person of
unwholesome practice.</p>
<p class="par">Such is the utter blindness of custom and prejudice that
in 1899 the daintiest maiden, who might faint at the sight of a mouse,
would occasionally smell the stench of a pig-sty, yet, without the
least compunction, would sit at table and enjoy a pork chop, pork stew,
pork roast, in fact pork in any form. At the mere mention of a horse
roast or horse stew, the same delicate young lady would manifest her
disdain, and if such dishes were set before her, her indignation might
turn into riot. This was in 1899.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 people acquired more &ldquo;horse sense.&rdquo;
Education, in time, broke down <span class="marginnote">Cleaner Than
Hogs or Chickens.</span> the barriers of pure prejudice and senseless
custom. In that year it became recognized and fully acknowledged that
the cleanest member of the animal kingdom, the horse, was fit food for
human beings who had the strength of stomach to eat the hog, one of the
filthiest, filth-devouring animals known to man, an animal whose flesh
was regarded with horror by many branches of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>human family, animals into which our Savior did
not hesitate to cast devils. In 1999 it was the universal belief that
people who could stomach pork and take their chances in contracting
trichin&aelig;, could well afford to digest the clean, wholesome flesh
of horses. No animal has any cleaner habits, or more wholesome food
than the horse. Such is custom, habit and prejudice. If our ancestors
had taught us from the days of the C&aelig;sars to eat horse flesh and
to shun pork and poultry, it is more than probable that a man caught
eating the latter would have been driven from any community as a
disgrace to his kind.</p>
<p class="par">Prejudice and custom are hard task masters. In 1925 it
became a custom to eat <span class="marginnote">Eating Raw Fish.</span>
raw fish. The fish in such cases were carefully cleaned before serving.
The head, entrails and other parts were removed and the raw flesh was
served with salt and pepper. Even this simple process required an
education. Many with capricious stomachs revolted at the treatment.
They could not digest raw fish that had been killed and nicely cleaned
before eating, but they would readily eat any quantity of raw oysters
from the shell, also clams, and eat them while the bivalves were still
alive.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;servant question&rdquo; reached a very
satisfactory solution long before 1999. As early as 1907, State Normal
schools to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>teach the culinary art and to educate servants
were instituted. In the nineteenth century the servant class in America
was the hoodoo of the housekeeper and homemaker. Thousands of young
women in 1899, without the slightest knowledge or qualifications as
housekeepers, entered into matrimony. Unable to cook a loaf of bread or
make a simple biscuit, hardly knowing the <span class="marginnote">Some
Very &ldquo;Lame&rdquo; Cooks.</span> difference between hot and cold
water, these zealous but inexperienced wives suddenly discovered
themselves in charge of a household and all its responsibilities. In
this unhappy condition they relied upon hired help to do the work. In
many instances the servant knew as little about cooking as her newly
wedded mistress. It was a case of &ldquo;the blind leading the
blind,&rdquo; and much unhappiness resulted.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the 20th century public exigencies demanded a
radical change. The servant question advanced to the front. The dignity
of her position was raised in the social scale. The backward
civilization of 1899 treated the servant as a drudge or menial. Long
hours of service, from early morn till late at night, were imposed upon
her, while her wages were slender. In the country her life was more
endurable because she was often treated as a member of the family. In
cities, however, her lot was an unhappy one. The servant plodded along
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>in her solitary work, often busy and at work
fifteen hours every day. Even in free-born, liberty-loving America the
servant in 1899 was made to regard herself as an inferior being.</p>
<p class="par">It was in this chaotic condition of affairs that schools
for the instruction of housekeepers were opened and assisted by large
annuities from the State. Before 1950 every town in the several States
throughout the Americas boasted of its State Cooking <span class=
"marginnote">State Schools for Cooking.</span> School. These schools
became very popular in the Central American States such as Mexico, San
Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, as well as in the southern States of
Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and others of that group of the
American Union. As a result of this wise policy the fame and laurels of
French cookery were transferred to our American culinary artists. Not
even the famed cooks of China could equal the skill of the instructed
and trained American cooks. No servant could get a situation as cook in
1999 unless they could produce a diploma from a State School of
Cookery. They demanded more pay and were allowed to work only eight
hours per day. As a result of having skilled housekeepers, homes were
rendered better and happier.</p>
<p class="par">In 1999 America still remained the land of model hotels.
In the 19th century the fame of Americans for maintaining the best
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>conducted and most palatial hostelries was
already world-wide. Our city palace-hotels had no rivals in the world
worthy of the name. In the twentieth century their enviable fame in
this line continued to increase. Chicago and Manhattan still maintained
their ancient rivalry in the hotel business. Many of the palace hotels
of 1999 had walls built with opaque, rock face glass in the most
attractive styles of architecture. From a distance they resembled fairy
palaces. Marble and brick were occasionally employed in construction
but glass came into high favor as being imperishable as well as highly
ornamental. The old saying that &ldquo;those who live in glass houses
should not throw stones,&rdquo; answered very well in the 19th century,
when glass houses, such as conservatories, were exceedingly fragile
structures. In the 20th century no structures could be more durable
than these hotels with glass walls, built with blocks of great
thickness and in every color of the prism. They were fire-proof for the
simple reason that no one had any use for fire in any hotel or public
building in 1999. Electricity was employed to the exclusion of all
other agencies for heating and lighting, as well as for motive power.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In 1999 the negro problem no longer troubled the
North American States. The absorption of the Central and South American
Republics into the great American Union, had at last vouchsafed the
earnestly prayed for outlet for the troublesome Ethiopians. The man who
was guilty of making the first importation of negroes into the American
Republic can never hope to rest comfortably in the great hereafter. The
negro during the last half of the nineteenth century proved a black
cloud in social and political America. A stupendous war was waged in
his behalf. Years after the close of the war he still remained a source
of bitter hatred and constant bloodshed. South of Mason and
Dixon&rsquo;s line the war of the <span class="marginnote">Literally a
&ldquo;Burning Question.&rdquo;</span> races raged furiously for nearly
sixty years after the close of the Civil War in 1865. The whites
despised, while the blacks detested. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>1899 Negroism was in
fact, as well as in metaphor, a burning question. In 1925 mention was
still frequently made of the burning of the negro Sam Hose, near
Palmetto, in Georgia. Whenever the slightest pretext offered itself,
negroes were lynched or burned alive at the stake. On the other hand
these cruelties upon their race were naturally resented by the blacks,
who lost no opportunity to make reprisals.</p>
<p class="par">The negro proved a very costly luxury, a profound study
in black, during the last half of the nineteenth century. Mainly on his
account a Titanic struggle was waged in the sixties, a continent was
torn asunder, 800,000 men killed and a debt of $7,100,000,000 saddled
on America, and in the opening days of the twentieth century, the negro
was still a thorn in the nation&rsquo;s side. <span class=
"marginnote">A Study in Black.</span> The negro found his way into
America only after the mild race of Indians discovered by Columbus had
been exterminated under the lash and torch of the Spaniard. When the
harmless and gentle race of beings who inhabited the isles of the
Caribbean sea had vanished before Spanish tyranny, then all eyes turned
to Africa as the base of supplies for menials, hewers of wood and
drawers of water. The docile nature of the negro rendered him available
for purposes of serfdom. He proved submissive and obedient, which are
qualities of excellence in the relations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>existing between
master and slave. The negro, without doubt, is gifted with a high order
of intelligence and is capable of appreciating all the advantages of a
superior education. It is doubtful, however, if the race will ever
become prominent in the field of art and sciences. With his amiable and
submissive tendencies the negro is menial in his qualifications. For
long centuries past he has been &ldquo;a servant of servants&rdquo; in
his native land and his position <span class="marginnote">Not Very
Fierce, Only Humble.</span> still remains unchanged. Had he the fierce
and indomitable love of freedom which characterizes the North American
Indian, the chains of slavery never would have blotted the fair name of
America. His introduction into this hemisphere has proved a colossal
blunder, a misfortune alike to both races.</p>
<p class="par">History will applaud the wisdom of American
statesmanship that emancipated the slave. No matter what may be his
shortcomings&mdash;or how inferior his position in the scale of
civilization, slavery of the negro cannot for one moment be tolerated
under the great American flag, the emblem of freedom for all peoples of
this earth. The flag, however, cannot guarantee his social status. From
this point of view, the fact cannot be denied that the presence of the
negro in North America is undesirable. In communities where his vote
preponderates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>there will always be friction with the whites.
Whites will never submit to the dictation of the black element. The
swarthy son of Ham was never permitted in the twentieth century to
dominate. The high white forehead cannot be ruled by the low black one.
Not in centuries could this be accomplished, in fact, never.</p>
<p class="par">The unquenchable hatred existing in the South found
expression in frequent lynchings of <span class="corr" id="xd21e2941"
title="Source: negros">negroes</span>, burnings and other barbarities.
These acts of violence were deplorable, and even in 1950 the burning of
Sam Hose in 1899 at Newman, Georgia, was constantly referred to. In
justice, however, to the South, it must be said, that these lynchings
were perpetrated as measures of self-defense.</p>
<p class="par">The races could not assimilate. Miscegenation was
regarded in the twentieth century, as well as in the nineteenth, as an
unpardonable crime.</p>
<p class="par">In 1925 the racial war between whites and blacks
continued unabated, and would <span class="marginnote">Peace in
Sight.</span> have still been in force in 1999 if the only one possible
relief had not come at last to the rescue. In the year last mentioned
the bulk of the black population disappeared from the North American
States. The accession of the Central and South American Republics into
the great American Union afforded the only possible solution to the
vexed problem. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>In 1960, just one hundred years after the
Sumpter episode, another important movement was inaugurated in behalf
of the blacks. People commenced to realize that the negro was an
utterly alien race; that when they landed here America gained nothing,
while Africa must have lost heavily through their transfer into the new
world. The proposition to transfer the negro population to the Central
and Southern American States was agitated in that year. The transfer of
Washington as the seat of our national government from the District of
Columbia to the City of Mexico had the effect of drawing a strong tide
of American emigration into the State of Mexico, and into the Southern
States of Brazil and Venezuela as well. In 1999 Americans spoke of
Colombia and Bolivar merely as Southern States of the Union. The vast
and fertile lands in those States did not escape the attention of
settlers. The idea of transferring the entire negro population from the
Northern States of Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama, Louisiana,
Virginia and the Carolinas to the Southern States of Brazil and
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2953" title=
"Source: Veneuzela">Venezuela</span> was regarded as being a good one.
The proposed measure proved a very popular one, particularly among the
Gulf States. They were ready to make any sacrifice to be rid of their
black neighbors.</p>
<p class="par">In 1975 a bill passed through Congress appropriating a
sum of $58,000,000 for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href=
"#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>purchase of three northern
provinces in the State of Venezuela, namely, Zarmora, <span class=
"marginnote">No Snowstorms out That Way.</span> Bermudez and Miranda,
bounded on the north by the Atlantic Ocean and on the south by the
Orinoco River. It was generally conceded that the negro would feel more
at home in a tropical climate. The three provinces named lie between
the eighth and tenth degrees of north latitude, and there was no
possible danger that these emigrants would ever get caught in a
snowstorm on the plains of Venezuela. The northern States of the Union
were determined to get rid of the entire race, if money ever could
effect that purpose.</p>
<p class="par">The negroes readily assented to the proposition and were
heartily in favor of <span class="marginnote">Were Pleased with the
Change.</span> leaving a section of the American Republic which has
been the scene of so much suffering to them, as well as their
ancestors. They were elated over the prospect of emigrating to the
State of Venezuela, where such a fine reservation had been purchased
for them by enactment of Congress. They realized that in the State of
Venezuela they would no longer be <span class="corr" id="xd21e2968"
title="Source: harrassed">harassed</span> by their white neighbors and
the old slave-owning element, and upon the vast pastoral plains of the
Zarmora and Miranda provinces they would till their own soil, own the
land and enjoy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>each other&rsquo;s exclusive society. Even
Boston, in 1975, applauded the movement as being a philanthropic one,
calculated to increase the well being of the negro. The brainy men of
Boston argued that reservations had been frequently purchased for the
use of Indians, and there was no good reason why one should not be
purchased for the use of the American negro.</p>
<p class="par">In this manner the vexed negro question was finally
settled. The States south of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s line became more
contented. The negro reservation in Venezuela thrived well. The broad
pastoral plains, well watered by branches of the Orinoco, abounding in
rich tropical grasses, were admirably adapted to the raising of cattle,
sheep and goats. Horses were raised in 1975 for food supplies alone.
The negro farmer invested in sugar cane, cotton, indigo and banana
farms. The tropical forests yielded much wealth, such as India rubber,
tonka beans, copaiba and vanilla, while the mineral products of
Venezuela proved rich and varied. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In setting forth at length the glorious
achievements of the twentieth century, the Author has no desire to rob
our now closing nineteenth century of one iota of its brilliantly
earned laurels. The achievements of the nineteenth century will grow to
the last syllable of recorded time. Their <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2985" title="Source: imprints">imprint</span> upon the history of
man is indelible and shall be linked in the chains of eternity.</p>
<p class="par">In the field of scientific discovery the nineteenth
century has no peer in all the preceding ages. It stands forth a giant
whose achievements in the cause of science, liberty, education and
humanity outweigh the combined products of all eras from the birth of
Christ.</p>
<p class="par">Newton&rsquo;s discovery of gravitation must ever
memorize the seventeenth century in the annals of men, but the genius
of the nineteenth century has produced its equal in the correlation and
conservation of forces, the widest generalization that the human mind
has yet attained.</p>
<p class="par">The telescope of the eighteenth century is overbalanced
by the spectroscope of the nineteenth, telling us of the composition,
rate of speed of myriads of suns. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>electric telegraph,
the telephone, the phonograph, wireless telegraphy, and the
R&ouml;entgen rays are all children of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="par">The vast doctrine of organic evolution, the periodic law
of chemistry, the molecular theory of gases, Kelvin&rsquo;s vortex
theory of matter, are all priceless jewels in the crown of the
nineteenth century. To these we must add in the nineteenth century
phalanx the magnificent discovery of an&aelig;sthetics and <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2998" title="Source: antisceptic">antiseptic</span>
surgery, the wonderful mobilization of man through the medium of steam
and electricity by land and sea.</p>
<p class="par">Let us give to the nineteenth century the full measure
of its magnificent conquests in the arts and sciences. But, to-day, we
stand at the threshold of the twentieth century, in which, with its
legacy of nineteenth century genius, still greater and more sweeping
results will be attained. Vast fields of scientific research remain
unexplored. Proud science must to-day bend her knee and confess
ignorance in many problems of the most simple character. The absolute
command of Mind over Matter calls for herculean strides of progress
before its sway be undisputed.</p>
<p class="par">The twentieth century, however, will pre-eminently
outrank all preceding eras in the measure of liberty accorded to the
peoples of the universe, and, in the foremost rank, as a pillar of fire
by night and a cloud by day, the leadership of great, broad America
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>will be followed by the nations of the
world.</p>
<p class="par">The Supreme Ruler of the universe, who holds this globe
in the hollow of His Hand, has marked out the line this nation must
follow and our duty must be done.</p>
<p class="par">America is destined to become the Light of the
World.</p>
<p class="par">With her grand Constitution for guide and compass, her
boundaries will extend until her banner of true freedom and liberty
shall spread its folds and protect every nation in the Western
Hemisphere, gathering them into one flock and one mighty Republic.</p>
<p class="par">In the year of grace, 1999, the light of God&rsquo;s sun
will reveal to the admiring gaze of the World, the noblest creation of
Man,&mdash;a United America, the law giver unto the nations of the
earth, a mighty power that shall dictate peace and banish war and make
True Freedom ring throughout the world.</p>
